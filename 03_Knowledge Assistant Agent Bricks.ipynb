    "# Introducing Agent Bricks: Knowledge Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "The Knowledge Assistant in Agent Bricks is designed to provide easy access to unstructured data, enabling users to get answers directly from their documents, PowerPoints, and other file types. By using advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), Knowledge Assistant transforms your documents into a high-quality, production-grade Q&A chatbot. This approach makes it ideal for scenarios where users need fast, accurate, and cited answers without manual data structuring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key benefits include:\n",
    "- Easy access to unstructured data: Users can query a wide range of file types—including PDFs, Word files, and slides—to obtain the information they need.\n",
    "- Built-in metrics & evaluation: measure how well you're doing against real-life questions and see improvements\n",
    "- Production-grade scalability: Scale out to production use cases and focus your energy on what matters\n",

This integrated dataset ensures the assistant can provide accurate, context-rich answers based on both established guidelines and real-world customer interactions."
