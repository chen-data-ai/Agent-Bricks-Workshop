    "# Introducing Agent Bricks: Knowledge Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "The Knowledge Assistant in Agent Bricks is designed to provide easy access to unstructured data, enabling users to get answers directly from their documents, PowerPoints, and other file types. By using advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), Knowledge Assistant transforms your documents into a high-quality, production-grade Q&A chatbot. This approach makes it ideal for scenarios where users need fast, accurate, and cited answers without manual data structuring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key benefits include:\n",
    "- Easy access to unstructured data: Users can query a wide range of file types—including PDFs, Word files, and slides—to obtain the information they need.\n",
    "- Built-in metrics & evaluation: measure how well you're doing against real-life questions and see improvements\n",
    "- Production-grade scalability: Scale out to production use cases and focus your energy on what matters\n",

    "### Demo Overview\n",
    "For this demo, we’re using a telecom dataset comprising two main components: a knowledge base and a set of support tickets. The knowledge base includes FAQs, troubleshooting guides, and company policies addressing various topics. The support tickets cover cases from 2024 and 2025, each paired with its corresponding resolution. By utilizing this dataset, we aim to create a knowledge assistant designed to deliver accurate and insightful assistance across diverse customer inquiries and interactions."

Agent Bricks is tightly integrated with MLflow 3, which is specifically designed for generative AI workflows — enabling robust tracking, tracing, and evaluation of agent behavior across the entire lifecycle\n",
