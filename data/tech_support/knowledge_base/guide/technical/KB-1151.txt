# Setting Up Wi-Fi Calling: Complete Technical Guide

## Introduction
Wi-Fi calling allows you to make and receive calls and texts over a Wi-Fi network instead of using your cellular connection. This feature is particularly useful in areas with weak cellular coverage but strong Wi-Fi signals. This guide will walk you through setting up Wi-Fi calling on various devices and troubleshooting common issues.

- Your device supports Wi-Fi calling
- You have an active cellular plan that includes Wi-Fi calling
- You're connected to a stable Wi-Fi network
- Your device software is up to date
- You have emergency address information ready (required by carriers for 911 services)
