# Complete Guide to Mobile Hotspot Setup

## Introduction
A mobile hotspot turns your smartphone into a portable Wi-Fi router, allowing you to share your cellular data connection with other devices like laptops, tablets, or other smartphones. This guide will help you set up your mobile hotspot correctly and troubleshoot common issues.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up your mobile hotspot:
- Ensure your data plan includes hotspot capabilities (some carriers require a specific plan)
- Check that you have sufficient data allowance (hotspot usage typically counts against your data plan)
- Verify your device has adequate battery (hotspot functionality drains battery quickly)
- Confirm you have cellular data connectivity (check that you can browse the web on your phone)

   - Expected result: Device connects to the hotspot and can access the internet

2. **Verify Connection**
