# Complete Guide to Call Forwarding Services

## What is Call Forwarding?

Call forwarding is a telecom feature that allows you to redirect incoming calls from one phone number to another destination. This service ensures you never miss important calls, even when you're away from your primary device or in an area with poor reception.

## Types of Call Forwarding

### Unconditional Call Forwarding
* Redirects all incoming calls immediately to another number
* Useful when you're unavailable for an extended period
* Usually activated with *21* followed by the forwarding number

### Conditional Call Forwarding
* **No Answer Forwarding**: Redirects calls only when you don't answer (typically after 15-30 seconds)
* **Busy Forwarding**: Redirects calls when your line is busy
* **Unreachable Forwarding**: Redirects calls when your device is turned off or out of network coverage

## Setting Up Call Forwarding

### On iPhone
1. Open the Phone app
2. Tap the keypad tab
3. For all calls: Dial *21* followed by the 10-digit number you want to forward to, then #
4. For busy/no answer: Dial *67* followed by the forwarding number, then #
5. Press the call button
6. Wait for confirmation message

### On Android
1. Open the Phone app
2. Tap the three-dot menu icon
3. Select "Settings" or "Call settings"
4. Tap "Call forwarding"
5. Choose your desired forwarding type
6. Enter the forwarding number
7. Tap "Enable" or "Turn on"

### Through Your Carrier's App
Most major carriers offer call forwarding management through their mobile apps:
* AT&T: "myAT&T" app > "Account" > "Device & features" > "Manage features"
* Verizon: "My Verizon" app > "Account" > "Add-ons & apps" > "Call features"
* T-Mobile: "T-Mobile" app > "More" > "Call settings"

## Compatibility and Limitations

* Available on virtually all carrier plans, though some prepaid plans may have restrictions
* International call forwarding may incur additional charges
* Most carriers limit the number of simultaneous forwards (typically up to 5)
* Call quality remains unchanged during forwarding
* Some advanced features may not be available when forwarding to landlines

## Optimization Tips

### Minimize Delays
* Use unconditional forwarding when immediate redirection is critical
* For conditional forwarding, adjust ring time before forwarding (if supported by carrier)

### Save Battery Life
* Use unreachable forwarding instead of keeping your phone powered on in poor coverage areas

### Manage Multiple Devices
* Create a forwarding chain for complex scenarios (e.g., office → mobile → home)
* Consider using simultaneous ring features instead of sequential forwarding for time-sensitive calls

## Advanced Features and Use Cases

### Time-Based Forwarding
Set up forwarding to activate automatically during specific hours:
1. Use your carrier's online account portal
2. Navigate to call management settings
3. Configure time-based rules for different numbers

### Selective Call Forwarding
Forward only specific callers to another number:
1. Create a contact group for VIP callers
2. Use your carrier's advanced call management settings
3. Set forwarding rules based on caller ID

### Business Applications
* **Customer Service**: Forward after-hours calls to an answering service
* **Team Collaboration**: Rotate forwarding among team members for shared responsibility
* **Remote Work**: Forward desk phone calls to mobile devices seamlessly

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Forwarding Not Working**: Verify activation codes and ensure destination number is entered correctly
* **Unexpected Charges**: Check with your carrier about forwarding fees, especially for international destinations
* **Can't Deactivate**: Use the universal deactivation code ##21# or contact customer support

## Managing Call Forwarding Remotely

If you forget to set up forwarding before leaving your phone:
1. Log into your carrier's online account portal
2. Navigate to call management settings
3. Configure forwarding remotely through the web interface
4. Alternatively, contact customer support to assist with remote activation

Remember to deactivate call forwarding when no longer needed to avoid missing calls at your primary number.
