# Account Suspension Process: Customer Guide

## Overview
Account suspension temporarily halts your telecom service while maintaining your phone number and account. This guide explains how to request a suspension, what happens during suspension, and how to reactivate your service.

## When to Consider Account Suspension
- Extended travel abroad
- Military deployment
- Seasonal residence changes
- Financial hardship (temporary)
- Lost or stolen device (temporary measure)

## Suspension Methods

### Online Account Management
1. Log in to your account at our website or via the mobile app (iOS/Android)
2. Navigate to "Account Settings" or "Manage Services"
3. Select "Suspend Service" or "Temporary Suspension"
4. Choose your suspension start date and duration (typically 30-180 days)
5. Verify your identity using your PIN or security questions
6. Review suspension terms and confirm

### Customer Service Phone Support
1. Call our customer service at 1-800-XXX-XXXX
2. Authenticate your identity (account PIN, last 4 of SSN, billing zip code)
3. Request account suspension and provide reason
4. Specify desired suspension period
5. Note your confirmation number for future reference

### In-Store Assistance
1. Visit any retail location with valid government-issued photo ID
2. Inform the representative you wish to suspend service
3. Complete and sign the suspension form
4. Receive a copy of your suspension agreement

## Security Verification Requirements
- Account owner's government-issued photo ID
- Account PIN/password
- Last 4 digits of SSN or Tax ID (for business accounts)
- Recent account activity verification
- For military suspension: Copy of deployment orders (for extended suspensions)

## During Suspension Period

### What Continues:
- Your phone number remains assigned to your account
- Basic account access for billing information
- Minimal account maintenance fees (typically $5-15/month)
- Contract time obligations are typically paused

### What Stops:
- All voice, text and data services
- Regular monthly service charges
- Add-on services and features

## Reactivation Process
1. Online: Log in to your account and select "Reactivate Service"
2. Phone: Call customer service and request reactivation
3. Automatic: Service automatically reactivates on your specified end date
4. In-store: Visit any retail location with ID to request early reactivation

## Processing Times
- Online/App requests: 1-4 hours processing time
- Phone requests: Immediate to 24 hours
- In-store requests: Immediate processing
- Reactivation: Typically 1-4 hours after request

## Important Considerations
- Suspension periods typically limited to 6 months per calendar year
- Partial month suspensions usually billed as full month of reduced fee
- Autopay settings may need adjustment during suspension
- Device insurance and protection plans may continue billing
- Early termination fees still apply if you cancel during suspension
