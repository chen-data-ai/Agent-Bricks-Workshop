# Account Security Guide for Telecom Customers

## Introduction
Protecting your telecom account from unauthorized access is essential to safeguard your personal information and prevent fraudulent activity. This guide outlines best practices and procedures for maintaining optimal account security.

## Setting Up Strong Account Security

### Creating a Secure Password
1. Choose a password that is at least 12 characters long
2. Include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters
3. Avoid using personal information like birthdays or names
4. Use a unique password not used for other accounts
5. Change your password every 3-6 months

### Enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
1. Log into your account through our mobile app or website
2. Navigate to "Security Settings" or "Account Settings"
3. Select "Two-Factor Authentication"
4. Choose your preferred verification method:
   - SMS text message (processing time: immediate)
   - Email verification code (processing time: immediate)
   - Authenticator app (processing time: 2-3 minutes for setup)
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete setup

**Security Consideration:** Authenticator apps (like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator) provide stronger security than SMS verification.

## Managing Account Access

### Authorized Users
1. To add an authorized user:
   - Online: Account Settings → User Management → Add User
   - Phone: Call customer service at 1-800-XXX-XXXX
   - In-store: Visit with both parties and valid ID
   
2. Required documentation:
   - Primary account holder's government-issued ID
   - Secondary user's government-issued ID
   - Completed authorization form (available online or in-store)

**Processing Time:** 24-48 hours for verification and activation

### Account PIN/Security Questions
1. Set up a PIN or security questions through:
   - Online: Security Settings → Verification Methods
   - Mobile App: Profile → Security → Manage Verification
   - Phone: Customer service guided setup
   - In-store: Representative assisted setup

**Security Consideration:** Choose questions with answers only you would know but that you won't forget.

## Monitoring Account Activity

### Setting Up Alerts
1. Navigate to "Notifications" or "Alerts" in your account settings
2. Enable alerts for:
   - Password changes
   - New device logins
   - Payment method changes
   - Address or contact information updates
   - Unusual account activity

**Processing Time:** Alert settings apply immediately

### Reviewing Account Activity
1. Check recent account activity through:
   - Mobile App: Activity tab (iOS and Android)
   - Online: Account Dashboard → Recent Activity
   - Phone: Request activity summary from customer service

**Security Consideration:** Review activity logs monthly to identify unauthorized changes

## Responding to Security Concerns

### If You Suspect Unauthorized Access
1. Immediately change your password
2. Contact customer support:
   - Phone: 1-800-XXX-XXXX (24/7 security hotline)
   - Live Chat: Available through website or mobile app
   - In-store: Visit any retail location
3. Request a security freeze on your account

**Processing Time:** Security freezes are applied immediately but may take up to 24 hours to fully process

### Recovering a Compromised Account
1. Verify your identity using:
   - Government-issued ID
   - Recent bill or account statement
   - Knowledge-based verification questions
2. Reset all security credentials
3. Review recent transactions and report unauthorized charges

**Processing Time:** Account recovery typically takes 1-2 business days

## Additional Security Best Practices
- Update contact information promptly to ensure you receive security alerts
- Never share account credentials or verification codes with others
- Log out of your account when using shared or public devices
- Keep your mobile device's operating system and our app updated
- Enable biometric authentication (fingerprint/face recognition) where available on iOS and Android devices
