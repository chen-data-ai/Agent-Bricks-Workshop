# How to Reactivate Your Telecom Service

When your service has been suspended or disconnected, you can follow these steps to get reconnected quickly and securely.

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have:
- Your account number or phone number
- A valid photo ID
- Payment method for any outstanding balances
- The last 4 digits of your Social Security Number (for verification)

## Reactivation Methods

### Online Reactivation (Fastest Method)

1. Visit our website or open the mobile app (available on iOS and Android)
2. Log in to your account (or select "Forgot Password" if needed)
3. Navigate to "Account Status" or "Service Management"
4. Select "Reactivate Service"
5. Verify your identity using one of the following:
   - Answer security questions
   - Enter a one-time verification code sent to your email/alternate phone
6. Pay any outstanding balance
7. Review and confirm service plan details
8. Submit your reactivation request

**Processing time:** Typically 15-30 minutes for service to resume

### Phone Reactivation

1. Call our Customer Support at 1-800-XXX-XXXX
2. Select the option for "Account Services" or "Reactivation"
3. Provide your account information to the representative
4. Complete identity verification (security questions, PIN)
5. Make necessary payments
6. Confirm your service plan

**Processing time:** 15-60 minutes after call completion

### In-Store Reactivation

1. Visit any of our retail locations during business hours
2. Bring your photo ID and account information
3. Inform the representative you need to reactivate service
4. Complete identity verification
5. Make any required payments
6. Review and confirm your service details

**Processing time:** Service typically restored before you leave the store

## Important Security Considerations

- For your protection, we require identity verification for all reactivations
- If your account was suspended due to suspected fraud, additional verification steps may be required
- Reactivation after non-payment requires settling the outstanding balance
- If your service was disconnected for more than 60 days, you may need to establish a new account

## After Reactivation

- Restart your device to ensure proper reconnection to the network
- Verify your service is working by making a test call or browsing the internet
- Check that your plan features are active in your online account or mobile app
- Contact Customer Support if your service isn't fully restored within the expected timeframe
