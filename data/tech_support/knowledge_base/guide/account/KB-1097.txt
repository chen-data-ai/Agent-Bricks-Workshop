# Port-Out Requirements: Customer Guide

## What is a Port-Out?

A port-out occurs when you transfer your phone number from our network to another service provider while maintaining the same number.

## Security Considerations

Port-outs require strict security verification to prevent unauthorized transfers and protect you from fraud:

* All account holders must provide identity verification
* There must be no active fraud alerts on your account
* Your account must be in good standing (no past due balances)
* Number must not be in a "frozen" state due to recent security concerns

## Required Documentation

Before initiating a port-out, prepare the following:

1. Account number (found on your bill or in your online account)
2. Account PIN or password
3. Government-issued photo ID
4. Last 4 digits of SSN (for primary account holder)
5. Billing address information

## Port-Out Process

### Online Method
1. Log into your account via our mobile app (iOS/Android) or website
2. Navigate to "Account Settings" > "Number Management"
3. Select "Transfer Number to Another Provider"
4. Complete the verification process
5. Receive your Account Number and Transfer PIN

### Phone Method
1. Call Customer Support at 1-800-XXX-XXXX
2. Verify your identity with the representative
3. Request a port-out authorization code
4. Note your account number and PIN for the new carrier

### In-Store Method
1. Visit any retail location with your photo ID
2. Ask a representative to help with a port-out request
3. Complete the required verification steps
4. Receive your transfer information

## Verification Requirements

You'll need to verify your identity through one of these methods:
* Two-factor authentication via text or email
* Answering security questions
* Biometric verification through the mobile app (fingerprint/facial recognition)

## Processing Times

* Simple port-outs: 1-3 business days
* Complex port-outs (business lines, multiple numbers): 3-7 business days
* Landline to mobile transfers: Up to 10 business days

## Important Notes

* Do NOT cancel your service before completing the port-out
* Your service remains active until the port is complete
* You may be responsible for early termination fees if under contract
* Port-out requests submitted after 3 PM may be processed the next business day
* International numbers may have additional requirements
