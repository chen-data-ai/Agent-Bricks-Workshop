# How to Resolve Billing Errors on Your Telecom Account

This guide will help you identify, report, and resolve billing errors on your telecom account through both the online portal and mobile app.

## Before You Begin
- Have your account number and PIN/password ready
- Have a copy of the bill with the error available
- Note the specific charges you believe are incorrect

## Step 1: Review Your Bill Thoroughly
1. Log into your account (online portal or mobile app)
2. Navigate to the "Billing" or "My Bill" section
3. Open the bill with the suspected error

**Expected outcome:** You should see a detailed breakdown of all charges.

**Troubleshooting tip:** If you can't see your bills online, ensure you're logged into the correct account or try clearing your browser cache.

## Step 2: Document the Billing Error
1. Identify the specific incorrect charge(s)
2. Take screenshots or make notes of the error
3. Calculate the correct amount you believe you should be charged

**Expected outcome:** You'll have clear documentation of the error to reference during your communication with customer service.

**Troubleshooting tip:** Compare with previous bills to confirm this is not a new legitimate charge (like a plan change or one-time fee).

## Step 3: Check for Known Billing Issues
1. Visit the "Announcements" or "Service Status" section of the website/app
2. Look for any notices about billing system issues
3. Check if there's an automated resolution process already in place

**Screenshot description:** The service status page showing system notifications and known issues.

**Expected outcome:** You'll know if the error is a known system-wide issue being addressed.

**Troubleshooting tip:** If using the app and this section isn't loading, try the website instead as it often has more detailed system status information.

## Step 4: Contact Customer Support
1. In the app: Tap the "Support" or "Help" icon, then "Contact Us"
2. On the website: Click "Support" or "Contact Us" (usually in the top menu or footer)
3. Select "Billing Issue" from the topic options

**Screenshot description:** The contact options screen showing different support channels (chat, call, email).

**Expected outcome:** You'll be connected with a billing specialist who can address your concern.

**Troubleshooting tip:** 
- iOS users: If in-app support isn't responding, try force-closing and reopening the app
- Android users: Check that the app has permission to send notifications if waiting for a callback

## Step 5: Explain the Billing Error Clearly
1. Provide your account details for verification
2. Explain the specific error with reference to your documentation
3. State your expected resolution (credit, adjustment, plan change, etc.)

**Expected outcome:** The representative acknowledges your issue and creates a case number.

**Troubleshooting tip:** If the representative doesn't understand the issue, ask to speak with a billing specialist or supervisor.

## Step 6: Track Your Resolution Case
1. Note the case/ticket number provided
2. In the app or website, go to "My Support Cases" or "Open Tickets"
3. Select your billing case to view status updates

**Screenshot description:** The support case tracking page showing the status of open support tickets.

**Expected outcome:** You'll see the current status of your billing dispute.

**Troubleshooting tip:** If your case doesn't appear within 24 hours, contact support again with your case number.

## Step 7: Review the Resolution
1. Once resolved, check your next bill or account balance
2. Verify that the correction has been properly applied
3. Confirm any credits or adjustments match what was agreed upon

**Screenshot description:** The account balance page showing recent adjustments and credits.

**Expected outcome:** Your account balance reflects the agreed-upon resolution.

**Troubleshooting tip:** If the correction doesn't appear on your next bill, it may appear as an adjustment on the following bill. If not resolved after two billing cycles, contact support again.

## Additional Resources
- Most billing adjustments appear within 1-2 billing cycles
- Keep all case numbers until the issue is fully resolved
