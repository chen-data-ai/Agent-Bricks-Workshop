# Network Coverage Issue Resolution Procedure
**Document ID:** NW-COV-TS-001  
**Last Updated:** [Current Date]  
**Classification:** Internal Support Document

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the systematic approach for diagnosing and resolving network coverage issues reported by customers. Following these steps will ensure consistent troubleshooting and efficient resolution of coverage-related problems.

## 2. Required Tools/System Access
- Customer account management system
- Network coverage mapping tool
- Network status dashboard
- Tower maintenance schedule database
- Device diagnostics platform
- Ticket management system
- Knowledge base access

## 3. Procedure Steps

### 3.1 Initial Assessment
1. Verify customer identity using standard authentication protocol
2. Confirm the following details:
   - Device make and model
   - Current location of service issue
   - Duration of the problem (intermittent vs. persistent)
   - Recent device changes (software updates, SIM changes)
   - Number of devices affected (single device vs. multiple)

### 3.2 Network Status Verification
1. Check network status dashboard for known outages in customer's area
   - If outage exists → Proceed to section 4.1
   - If no outage → Continue to next step
2. Verify tower maintenance schedule for planned work
   - If scheduled maintenance → Proceed to section 4.2
   - If no maintenance → Continue to next step

### 3.3 Coverage Analysis
1. Access coverage mapping tool
2. Input customer's location coordinates
3. Verify expected signal strength for the area
   - Strong expected coverage → Proceed to section 3.4
   - Weak/borderline coverage → Proceed to section 4.3
   - No expected coverage → Proceed to section 4.4

### 3.4 Device Diagnostics
1. Guide customer to access device settings:
   - **Android:** Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile Network
   - **iOS:** Settings > Cellular > Cellular Data Options
2. Verify network mode settings (5G/4G/3G/Auto)
3. Request customer perform the following:
   - Toggle Airplane mode on/off
   - Restart device
   - Check for carrier settings updates
4. Instruct customer to manually select network operator
5. Check device signal metrics:
   - Signal strength (dBm)
   - Band/frequency
   - Network registration status
6. Verify SIM card status and proper installation

### 3.5 Advanced Troubleshooting
1. Reset network settings on device
   - **Android:** Settings > System > Reset options > Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth
   - **iOS:** Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings
2. Check for device software updates
3. Test with alternate SIM card if available
4. Perform network settings refresh from backend system
5. Check for network congestion indicators in the area

## 4. Decision Trees

### 4.1 Known Network Outage
```
IF outage resolution time available:
    Inform customer of expected resolution time
    Create monitoring ticket with callback after estimated resolution
    Offer SMS notification when service is restored
ELSE:
    Create priority ticket for network operations
    Schedule customer callback within 4 hours
    Offer temporary solutions (Wi-Fi calling, call forwarding)
```

### 4.2 Scheduled Maintenance
```
IF maintenance ending within 2 hours:
    Inform customer of timeframe
    No ticket required
    Offer temporary solutions
ELSE:
    Create informational ticket
    Schedule callback after maintenance window
    Offer service credits per compensation policy
```

### 4.3 Weak Coverage Area
```
IF signal booster eligible:
    Initiate signal booster qualification process
    Create equipment request ticket
ELSE IF Wi-Fi calling capable:
    Configure Wi-Fi calling on device
    Verify functionality
ELSE:
    Document coverage feedback
    Submit to network planning team
    Offer alternative service options
```

### 4.4 No Coverage Area
```
IF recent coverage change:
    Create network investigation ticket
    Escalate to Tier 2 support
ELSE:
    Explain coverage limitations
    Offer roaming options if available
    Discuss contract options if service inadequate
```

## 5. Escalation Criteria
Escalate to Tier
