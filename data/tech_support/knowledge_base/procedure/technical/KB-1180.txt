# Technical Procedure: Resolving eSIM Activation Issues

**Document ID:** TP-ESIM-001  
**Version:** 2.3  
**Last Updated:** [Current Date]  
**Department:** Technical Support  

## 1. Overview

This document provides a systematic approach for diagnosing and resolving eSIM activation issues. Follow these procedures to efficiently troubleshoot customer problems with eSIM provisioning, activation, and functionality.

## 2. Required Tools/System Access

- Customer account management system (CAMS)
- eSIM provisioning platform (EPP)
- Network provisioning system (NPS)
- Device compatibility database
- Remote diagnostic tools
- Ticket management system

## 3. Preliminary Assessment

### 3.1 Verify Account Status
- Confirm customer identity using standard verification protocol
- Check account standing (active/suspended/past due)
- Verify customer has eSIM-eligible rate plan
- Confirm eSIM feature is properly added to customer account

### 3.2 Device Verification
- Confirm device model and OS version
- Verify device is eSIM compatible using device compatibility database
- Check if device is carrier locked/unlocked
- Verify device IMEI is properly registered in our systems

## 4. Diagnostic Procedure

### 4.1 Initial Diagnostics
1. Verify eSIM order status in EPP
2. Check for pending or failed provisioning requests
3. Confirm QR code/activation code was generated correctly
4. Verify activation code has not expired (valid for 14 days)
5. Check network logs for failed activation attempts

### 4.2 Device-Side Verification
1. Confirm device has latest OS version
2. Verify Wi-Fi or cellular data connection is active and stable
3. Check for any conflicting profiles on device
4. Verify device storage has adequate space
5. Confirm device is not in airplane mode or restricted mode

## 5. Resolution Procedures

### 5.1 QR Code/Activation Code Issues
1. Delete failed activation attempt in EPP
2. Generate new eSIM activation code
3. Send new QR code via preferred customer channel (email/SMS/app)
4. Guide customer through proper scanning procedure
5. Verify activation success in real-time

### 5.2 Profile Download Issues
1. Instruct customer to:
   - Ensure stable Wi-Fi connection
   - Disable VPN if active
   - Clear cache in cellular settings (device-specific steps)
2. Manually push profile from EPP
3. Monitor download progress in real-time
4. Verify profile installation status

### 5.3 Network Registration Issues
1. Check network registration status in NPS
2. Verify IMSI is properly provisioned
3. Reset network settings on device (provide device-specific instructions)
4. Perform OTA update to refresh network parameters
5. Verify signal acquisition and service functionality

## 6. Decision Tree

```

├── Is account in good standing?
│   ├── NO → Resolve account issues first
│   └── YES → Continue
├── Is device eSIM compatible?
│   ├── NO → Recommend compatible device or physical SIM
│   └── YES → Continue
├── Was QR code/activation code generated?
│   ├── NO → Generate new code
│   └── YES → Continue
├── Was QR code scanned successfully?
│   ├── NO → Troubleshoot scanning issues
│   └── YES → Continue
├── Did profile download complete?
│   ├── NO → Troubleshoot download issues
│   └── YES → Continue
├── Is profile showing as active on device?
│   ├── NO → Verify profile status
│   └── YES → Continue
├── Is device registering on network?
│   ├── NO → Troubleshoot network registration
│   └── YES → Activation successful
END
```

## 7. Escalation Criteria

Escalate to Tier 2 Support if:
- Multiple activation attempts have failed
- Profile downloads but fails to register on network after all troubleshooting steps
- System shows successful activation but device cannot connect to network
- Incompatibility between account configuration and device capabilities
- Suspected network provisioning issue

Escalate to
