# Technical Procedure: Resolving Device Overheating Issues

**Document ID:** TP-DEV-OH-2023-01  
**Last Updated:** [Current Date]  
**Department:** Technical Support  
**Classification:** Internal Use Only

## 1. Overview

This document provides a systematic approach for diagnosing and resolving device overheating issues on customer smartphones and tablets. Device overheating can lead to performance degradation, battery damage, and safety concerns.

## 2. Required Tools/System Access

- Customer account access (CRM)
- Knowledge Base access
- Remote Diagnostic Tool (RDT) access
- Device specifications database
- Case management system

## 3. Procedure

### 3.1 Initial Assessment

1. Verify customer identity following standard authentication protocol
2. Document the following information:
   - Device make and model
   - Operating system version (iOS or Android)
   - When overheating occurs (during specific activities, charging, or idle)
   - Duration of the issue
   - Any recent changes (new apps, updates, physical damage)
   - Current temperature reading if available through RDT

### 3.2 Diagnostic Steps

1. **Run remote diagnostics** (if device is operational)
   - Launch Remote Diagnostic Tool
   - Select "Hardware Diagnostics" > "Temperature Analysis"
   - Record CPU, battery, and ambient temperature readings
   - Compare against normal operating parameters in specifications database

2. **Analyze battery health**
   - For iOS: Access Battery Health percentage (Settings > Battery > Battery Health)
   - For Android: Use RDT to check battery health metrics
   - Document charging cycles and battery age

3. **Review running processes**
   - Check for resource-intensive applications
   - Identify background processes with high CPU usage
   - Note any system processes showing abnormal activity

## 4. Resolution Path Decision Tree

```
START
|
+-- Are temperature readings within normal range?
|   |
|   +-- YES --> Perceived overheating may be normal under current usage
|   |           Proceed to customer education (5.1)
|   |
|   +-- NO --> Continue diagnostics
|       |
|       +-- Is device case preventing proper ventilation?
|       |   |
|       |   +-- YES --> Recommend case removal (5.2)
|       |   |
|       |   +-- NO --> Continue
|       |
|       +-- Are resource-intensive apps running?
|           |
|           +-- YES --> Proceed to software optimization (5.3)
|           |
|           +-- NO --> Check for system issues (5.4)
|
+-- Is battery health below 80%?
    |
    +-- YES --> Potential battery issue (5.5)
    |
    +-- NO --> Continue with software diagnostics
```

## 5. Resolution Steps

### 5.1 Normal Operating Temperature Education

1. Explain normal operating temperatures (35-45Â°C during heavy usage)
2. Provide usage recommendations to minimize heat generation
3. Document in case notes: "Educated customer on normal device operating temperatures"

### 5.2 Physical Ventilation Improvement

1. Instruct customer to remove case while using intensive applications
2. Recommend using device on hard surfaces rather than soft surfaces (beds, couches)
3. Advise against charging while using processor-intensive applications

### 5.3 Software Optimization

1. Guide customer to close unused applications:
   - iOS: Double-tap home button/swipe up from bottom, swipe apps up to close
   - Android: Tap recent apps button, swipe apps away or tap "Close All"
2. Identify and address problematic apps:
   - Check battery usage statistics for power-hungry applications
   - Recommend updating or uninstalling problematic apps
3. Clear system cache:
   - iOS: Guide through restart process
   - Android: Navigate to Settings > Storage > Cache > Clear Cache

### 5.4 System Issues Resolution

1. Check for pending system updates and install if available
2. Perform soft reset:
   - iOS: Guide through restart process
   - Android: Power off device for 30 seconds, then restart
3. If issue persists, perform factory reset as last resort (ensure data backup first)

### 5.5 Battery Assessment

1. Run battery
