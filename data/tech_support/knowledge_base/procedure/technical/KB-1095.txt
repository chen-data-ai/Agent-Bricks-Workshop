# Technical Support Procedure: Resolving Phone Not Receiving Calls

**Document ID:** TS-CALL-001  
**Last Updated:** [Current Date]  
**Department:** Technical Support  
**Access Level:** Internal Support Staff  

## 1. Overview

This procedure guides support agents through diagnosing and resolving issues where customers report their mobile device is not receiving incoming calls. This document follows a systematic approach to identify and address common causes while providing clear escalation paths for complex scenarios.

## 2. Required Tools/System Access

- Customer account management system (CRM)
- Network diagnostic tools (NetDiag)
- Call routing verification system (CallTrace)
- Device compatibility database
- Trouble ticket system
- Remote SIM provisioning tool (if applicable)

## 3. Procedure

### 3.1 Initial Assessment

1. **Verify customer identity** using standard authentication protocol
2. **Document issue details**:
   - Exact symptoms (all calls or specific callers)
   - Issue onset timing
   - Recent changes to device/account
   - Call behavior (rings for caller but not recipient, goes straight to voicemail, etc.)
3. **Verify account status**:
   - Confirm account is active and in good standing
   - Check for payment blocks or service restrictions
   - Verify no recent porting activity

### 3.2 Network Diagnostics

1. **Check network coverage**:
   - Verify customer's current location has adequate coverage
   - Check for known outages in customer's area (NetDiag tool)
   - Confirm device shows network connectivity indicators

2. **Verify call routing**:
   - Run CallTrace diagnostic for customer's number
   - Check for call forwarding settings
   - Verify voicemail configuration is correct

3. **Test basic connectivity**:
   - Have customer toggle Airplane Mode on/off
   - Verify data connectivity functions
   - If possible, test outgoing calls

### 3.3 Device Configuration

1. **Check device settings**:
   - Verify Do Not Disturb is disabled
   - Check Call Blocking settings for blocked numbers
   - Confirm Call Forwarding is disabled (unless intentionally enabled)
   - Check Focus/Silent modes (iOS) or Do Not Disturb (Android)

2. **SIM verification**:
   - Verify SIM is properly seated
   - Check SIM status in account system
   - Test with known working SIM if available

3. **Software verification**:
   - Check OS version is current
   - Verify carrier settings are updated
   - Check for pending device updates

## 5. Advanced Troubleshooting

1. **Network registration reset**:
