# Technical Support Procedure: Resolving Cellular Data Connectivity Issues

**Document ID:** TS-DATA-001  
**Last Updated:** [Current Date]  
**Classification:** Internal Support Document  
**Systems Required:** Customer Account Management System (CAMS), Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT), Billing System

## 1. Overview

This procedure guides support agents through a systematic approach to diagnose and resolve cellular data connectivity issues reported by customers. Following these steps will help identify whether the problem stems from account/billing issues, device configuration, network coverage, or hardware malfunction.

## 2. Required Tools/System Access

- Customer Account Management System (CAMS) - Level 2 access
- Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT) - Basic diagnostic access
- Billing System - Account status verification access
- Network Coverage Map Tool
- Device Troubleshooting Guide Database
- Ticket Management System

## 3. Diagnostic Procedure

### 3.1 Initial Assessment

1. Verify customer identity using standard authentication protocol
2. Document the following information:
   - Device make and model
   - Operating system version
   - SIM card number (ICCID)
   - When the issue began
   - Any recent changes (software updates, travel, plan changes)
   - Error messages displayed (if any)

### 3.2 Account Verification

1. Access CAMS to verify:
   - Account status (active/suspended)
   - Data plan details and allowances
   - Data usage for current billing cycle
   - Any data speed restrictions or throttling in effect
   - Recent plan changes or billing issues

**Decision Point:**
- If account is suspended → Proceed to Section 4.1
- If data limit exceeded → Proceed to Section 4.2
- If account is active with available data → Continue to Section 3.3

### 3.3 Network Status Check

1. Access NDT to verify:
   - Network status in customer's area
   - Any reported outages or maintenance
   - Tower performance metrics
   - Expected signal strength at customer location

**Decision Point:**
- If network outage confirmed → Proceed to Section 4.3
- If no network issues detected → Continue to Section 3.4

### 3.4 Device Configuration Check

1. Guide customer to verify:
   - Cellular data is enabled (Settings > Cellular/Mobile Data)
   - Airplane mode is disabled
   - Data roaming settings (if applicable)
   - APN settings match recommended configuration
   - Mobile data is enabled for specific apps (if applicable)

2. For iOS devices:
   - Navigate to Settings > Cellular > Cellular Data Options
   - Verify correct network mode selection (5G/LTE/3G)
   - Check for carrier settings updates

3. For Android devices:
   - Navigate to Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile Network
   - Verify preferred network type
   - Check Access Point Names (APN) settings

**Decision Point:**
- If configuration issue identified and resolved → Proceed to Section 5
- If configuration appears correct → Continue to Section 3.5

### 3.5 Device Troubleshooting

1. Guide customer through basic device troubleshooting:
   - Toggle Airplane mode on/off
   - Restart device
   - Remove and reinsert SIM card (if accessible)
   - Reset network settings

2. Perform signal strength test:
   - Guide customer to check signal bars/indicator
   - Document signal strength in dBm if available
   - Test in multiple locations if possible

3. Test alternative data connections:
   - Verify if Wi-Fi connectivity works properly
   - Test if voice calls function normally

**Decision Point:**
- If issue resolved during troubleshooting → Proceed to Section 5
- If issue persists → Continue to Section 3.6

### 3.6 Advanced Diagnostics

1. Access NDT to perform:
   - Remote SIM card validation
   - IMEI verification and status check
   - Network registration status check
   - Data connection test to cell tower

2. Perform device-specific diagnostics:
   - Check for software updates
   - Verify compatibility with network bands
   - Check for known issues with device model/OS version

## 4. Resolution Paths

### 4.1 Account Status Resolution

1. If suspended due to payment:
   - Inform customer of outstanding
