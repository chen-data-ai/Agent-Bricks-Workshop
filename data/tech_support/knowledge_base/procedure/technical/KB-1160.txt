# Technical Support Procedure: Device Setup Resolution

## Document Purpose
This procedure guides support agents through systematic device setup troubleshooting for customer devices. Follow these steps sequentially to efficiently diagnose and resolve setup issues.

## Required Tools/Access
- Customer account management system
- Network diagnostic tools
- Device compatibility database
- Remote assistance software (when applicable)
- Knowledge base access for device-specific documentation

## Procedure Steps

### 1. Initial Assessment
   a. Verify customer identity using account verification protocol
   b. Document device make, model, OS version, and IMEI/serial number
   c. Determine setup stage where failure occurred:
      - Initial power-on
      - Network connection
      - Account authentication
      - Service activation
      - App installation/configuration

### 2. Device Verification
   a. Confirm device compatibility with network
   b. Check if device is carrier-locked
   c. Verify device is not blacklisted/reported stolen
   d. Confirm firmware version is current for service compatibility
   
### 3. Network Diagnostics
   a. Verify SIM card is properly inserted and not damaged
   b. Check network signal strength in customer location
   c. Confirm appropriate network bands are available
   d. Test data connectivity if applicable to setup process

### 4. Account Verification
   a. Confirm account status is active
   b. Verify service has been properly provisioned
   c. Check for any account restrictions or billing issues
   d. Ensure device is properly associated with customer account

### 5. Guided Setup Process
   a. Power cycle device (document specific timing requirements)
   b. Guide through manual network selection if automatic fails
   c. Assist with account login procedures
   d. Walk through app installation if required for service

## Decision Trees

### Network Connection Issues
```
Is SIM properly inserted? → NO → Guide customer through proper insertion
                         → YES ↓
Is network detected?     → NO → Try manual network selection
                         → YES ↓
Can device register?     → NO → Check account provisioning
                         → YES ↓
Data connectivity?       → NO → Verify APN settings
                         → YES → Proceed to account verification
```

### Account Authentication Issues
```
Credentials accepted?    → NO → Verify username/password
                         → YES ↓
Account active?          → NO → Transfer to billing department
                         → YES ↓
Service provisioned?     → NO → Initiate provisioning
                         → YES → Proceed to service activation
```

## Expected Outcomes
- Device successfully connects to network
- Customer can authenticate to account
- All subscribed services are accessible
- Device-specific apps function properly
- Customer can make/receive calls and use data services

## Escalation Criteria
Escalate to Tier 2 support if:
- Device passes all diagnostics but still cannot connect
- Network registration succeeds but authentication repeatedly fails
- Provisioning shows complete but services remain unavailable
- Device-specific error codes appear (reference error code database)
- Setup process fails after 3 complete attempts

## Reference Documentation
- Device-specific setup guides (KB articles DB-100 through DB-355)
- Network compatibility matrix (document NET-2023-Q4)
- Provisioning troubleshooting handbook (document PROV-TS-2023)
- SIM card diagnostic procedures (document SIM-DIAG-2023)

## Post-Resolution Steps
1. Verify all services are functioning
2. Document specific resolution in customer account notes
3. Inform customer of any pending network/system changes
4. Schedule follow-up if intermittent issues were reported
5. Direct customer to self-service resources for future reference
