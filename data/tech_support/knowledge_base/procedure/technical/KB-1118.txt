# Technical Procedure: International Roaming Setup Resolution

## Document Purpose
This procedure guides support agents through diagnosing and resolving international roaming issues for customers. Follow these steps sequentially to ensure efficient troubleshooting and resolution.

## Required Tools/System Access
- Customer account management system (CAMS)
- Roaming partner database (RPD)
- Network provisioning system (NPS)
- Line testing tool (LTT)
- Knowledge base access
- Ticket management system

## Procedure Overview

### 1. Initial Assessment
1. Verify customer identity using standard authentication protocol
2. Confirm travel dates and destination country/countries
3. Verify device IMEI through CAMS
4. Check device compatibility with destination networks using RPD
5. Confirm account status and eligibility for international services

### 2. Account Verification
1. Access customer account in CAMS
2. Verify account is in good standing (no payment blocks)
3. Check for existing international plan activation
4. Confirm roaming capability is not restricted on the account
5. Verify line has been active for minimum required period (30 days for prepaid, 90 days for new postpaid)

### 3. Device Configuration Assessment
1. Determine device make and model
2. Verify device is unlocked (if applicable)
3. Check if device supports bands/frequencies used in destination country
4. Confirm device has latest firmware/carrier settings
5. Document current network settings configuration

### 4. Network Provisioning Verification
1. Access NPS
2. Verify IMSI and MSISDN are properly mapped
3. Check HLR/HSS records for roaming permissions
4. Verify roaming agreements exist with carriers in destination country
5. Confirm data roaming APN settings are correctly provisioned

## Diagnostic Decision Tree

### A. If Account Issue Detected:
1. Is account suspended or restricted?
   - YES → Resolve account standing issues first
   - NO → Proceed to step 2

2. Is international roaming feature active?
   - YES → Proceed to step 3
   - NO → Add feature using procedure IR-ADD-001

3. Is customer on compatible rate plan?
   - YES → Proceed to Device Configuration Assessment
   - NO → Recommend plan change using procedure IR-PLAN-002

### B. If Device Configuration Issue Detected:
1. Is device locked to home network?
   - YES → Initiate unlock procedure IR-UNLOCK-003
   - NO → Proceed to step 2

2. Are device bands compatible with destination?
   - YES → Proceed to step 3
   - NO → Document incompatibility, offer loaner device option

3. Are APN settings correct?
   - YES → Proceed to Network Provisioning Verification
   - NO → Configure using procedure IR-APN-004

### C. If Network Provisioning Issue Detected:
1. Is IMSI properly provisioned?
   - YES → Proceed to step 2
   - NO → Create provisioning ticket using IR-PROV-005

2. Do roaming agreements exist with destination carriers?
   - YES → Proceed to step 3
   - NO → Document limitations, offer alternative solutions

3. Is there a network outage or known issue?
   - YES → Create ticket referencing outage ID
   - NO → Proceed to Final Configuration

## Final Configuration

1. Configure device settings:
   - Enable Data Roaming: Settings > Cellular/Mobile Data > Data Roaming ON
   - Set Network Selection to Automatic
   - Reset Network Settings if persistent issues exist

2. Verify SMS capability:
   - Send test SMS to customer's alternative number
   - Confirm receipt of welcome SMS from partner network

3. Verify data connectivity:
   - Instruct customer to disable Wi-Fi temporarily
   - Confirm data connection using mobile data test

4. Document configuration in customer notes:
   - Record all settings changed
   - Note any specific carrier recommendations for destination

## Expected Outcomes
- Customer device connects to partner networks in destination country
- Voice calls function properly (incoming and outgoing)
- SMS messages can be sent and received
- Data connectivity works at expected speeds
- Customer receives appropriate usage notifications

## Escalation Criteria
Escalate to Tier 2 Support if:
- Account shows proper provisioning but device fails to connect after all
