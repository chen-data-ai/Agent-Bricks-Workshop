## Purpose
This procedure outlines the standardized process for handling customer refund requests in accordance with company policy while maintaining customer satisfaction.

## Procedure

### 1. Initial Refund Request Assessment
1. Acknowledge the customer's refund request professionally and empathetically

3. Verify the customer's identity using at least two authentication methods:
   - Account PIN/password
   - Last 4 digits of payment method
   - Recent transaction details
   - Security questions

### 2. Account and Transaction Verification
1. Access the customer's account in the billing system
2. Verify the disputed charge or payment in question
3. Review account history for:
   - Payment history (last 6 months)
   - Previous refund requests
   - Service modifications relevant to the claim
4. Document the verification process in the customer's account notes

### 3. Eligibility Determination
1. Determine if the refund request falls within the company's refund policy:
   - Time limitations (typically within 60 days of charge)
   - Service agreement terms
   - Applicable regulatory requirements
2. Check for special circumstances:
   - Service outages documented in the system

   - Supervisors: Up to $500

   - Credit to account
   - Return to original payment method
