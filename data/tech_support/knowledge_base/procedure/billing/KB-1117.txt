4. Take screenshots or create reference numbers for the disputed charges in the billing system

### 3. Initial Investigation
1. Verify usage patterns in the account management system
2. Check for recent plan changes, promotions, or service modifications
3. Review previous bill cycles to identify if this is a recurring or one-time charge
4. Consult knowledge base for known billing issues related to the charge type
