# Procedure: Managing Prepaid vs. Postpaid Billing Inquiries

## Purpose
This procedure guides customer support representatives in effectively addressing billing inquiries and issues for both prepaid and postpaid customers while ensuring proper verification, documentation, and compliance with company policies.

## Prepaid Customer Billing Support

### Initial Verification
1. Verify customer identity by requesting the mobile number and at least two of the following: account PIN, last 4 digits of payment method, or recent transaction details.
2. Confirm prepaid account status in the Customer Management System (CMS) by checking the current balance and service expiration date.
3. Review the customer's recent payment and usage history (last 90 days) to identify potential issues.

4. For balance inquiries, inform customers they can also check their balance via:
   - The mobile app (iOS/Android)
   - USSD code *123#
   - SMS to 12345 with text "BAL"
   - Online account portal

5. For payment issues:
   - Verify payment receipt details (date, amount, confirmation number)
   - Check for system delays (allow up to 4 hours for processing)
   - Resend confirmation if payment is confirmed but not reflected

6. For disputed charges:
   - Review itemized usage details with the customer
   - Explain any applicable fees or taxes
   - Process refunds up to $20 without approval
