# Late Payment Fee Management Procedure

## Purpose
This procedure outlines the standardized process for handling late payment fee inquiries, waiver requests, and adjustments to ensure consistent customer service while maintaining compliance with company policies.

## Procedure

### 1. Verify Customer Identity
1. Request the account holder's full name and phone number
2. Verify at least two additional identifiers:
   - Last 4 digits of SSN/Tax ID
   - Account PIN/Password
   - Billing address
3. Confirm the verification meets security protocols before proceeding

### 2. Review Account Payment History
1. Access the customer's billing history in the Account Management System
2. Note the following key information:
   - Current outstanding balance
   - Payment due date
   - Late fee amount(s)
   - Previous late payment history (last 12 months)
   - Customer tenure
   - Current account standing (good standing, collections, etc.)

### 3. Determine Fee Waiver Eligibility
1. First-time late payment (within 12 months): Eligible for full waiver
2. Customer with 12+ months perfect payment history: Eligible for full waiver
3. Late payment within 1-3 days of due date: Eligible for full waiver
4. Second late payment (within 12 months): Eligible for 50% waiver
5. Three or more late payments (within 12 months): Not eligible for waiver
6. Technical/system issues affecting payment processing: Eligible for full waiver

### 4. Process Fee Waiver (If Eligible)
1. Select "Fee Adjustment" in the billing system
2. Choose "Late Payment Fee" from the fee type dropdown
3. Enter the appropriate waiver amount
4. Select the corresponding waiver reason code
5. Add detailed notes explaining the justification for the waiver
6. Submit the adjustment for processing
7. Verify the adjustment appears correctly in the account history

### 5. Handle Non-Eligible Waiver Requests
1. Explain the late fee policy clearly and respectfully
2. Reference specific account history that affects eligibility
3. Offer alternative solutions:
   - Payment arrangement for the outstanding balance
   - Enrollment in autopay to prevent future late fees
   - Information about payment reminder options via the mobile app
   - Due date adjustment to better align with customer's pay schedule

### 6. Escalation Path
1. If customer remains dissatisfied with the decision:
   - For accounts with 2+ years tenure: Escalate to Team Lead
   - For accounts with significant monthly spend (>$150): Escalate to Team Lead
   - For customers threatening cancellation: Escalate to Retention Team
2. Document the escalation reason in the customer notes
3. Transfer the call or create an escalation ticket as appropriate

### 7. Documentation Requirements
1. Record all fee waiver decisions in the account notes including:
   - Reason for the waiver or denial
   - Policy exception justification (if applicable)
   - Supervisor approval (if required)
   - Customer education provided
2. Update the customer's late payment history tracker
3. Tag the interaction with appropriate category codes for reporting

### 8. Customer Education
1. Explain how to avoid future late fees:
   - Set up autopay through online account or mobile app (iOS/Android)
   - Enable payment reminders via text/email/app notifications
   - Use the mobile app payment calendar feature
   - Explain grace period policy
2. Confirm the customer understands the information provided

### 9. Follow-Up Actions
1. If payment has not yet been made, assist with payment processing
2. Send a confirmation email/text summarizing the resolution
3. Schedule a follow-up notification if payment arrangements were made
4. Flag account for review if systemic billing issues were identified
