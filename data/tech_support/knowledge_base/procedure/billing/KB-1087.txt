# Procedure: Managing Customer Billing Cycle Change Requests

## Purpose
This procedure outlines the step-by-step process for customer service representatives to handle billing cycle change requests from customers while maintaining compliance with company policies and ensuring customer satisfaction.

## Procedure

### 1. Initial Request Handling
1. Acknowledge the customer's request to change their billing cycle date
2. Verify the customer's identity using at least two authentication methods:
   - Account PIN/password
   - Last 4 digits of SSN or Tax ID
   - Recent transaction details
   - Answers to security questions

### 2. Account Assessment
1. Review the customer's account status in the Billing Management System (BMS)
2. Confirm the account is in good standing (no outstanding balance over 30 days)
3. Verify the customer has not changed their billing cycle in the past 6 months
4. Check if the account is under contract with specific billing terms that may restrict changes

### 3. Explaining Options & Implications
1. Inform the customer of available billing cycle dates (1st, 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, or 25th of each month)
2. Explain potential implications of changing the billing cycle:
   - Prorated charges on the next bill
   - Possible one-time shorter/longer billing period during transition
   - Changes to autopay scheduling if enabled
   - Updated due dates for future payments

### 4. Processing the Change
1. Access the "Billing Configuration" module in the BMS
2. Select "Modify Billing Cycle" from the dropdown menu
3. Enter the customer's account number
4. Select the requested new billing date
5. Review the system-calculated proration details with the customer
6. Confirm the customer accepts any prorated charges or adjustments
7. Submit the change request in the system

### 5. Authorization & Approval
1. For changes within standard parameters:
   - Process immediately if within your authorization level ($50 proration threshold)
2. For changes requiring approval:
   - Submit request through the Approval Queue System if proration exceeds $50
   - Inform customer of approval timeline (24-48 hours)

### 6. Documentation Requirements
1. Document the interaction in the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system:
   - Original billing cycle date
   - New billing cycle date
   - Reason for change request
   - Confirmation of customer's understanding of implications
   - Any special circumstances or exceptions applied

### 7. Customer Confirmation
1. Provide the customer with a confirmation number for the change request
2. Explain when the new billing cycle will take effect (typically next billing period)
3. Inform the customer they will receive an email/SMS confirmation
4. Direct the customer to verify the change in their online account or mobile app (available for both iOS and Android)

### 8. Follow-up Actions
1. Set a task reminder to verify the billing cycle change was successfully implemented
2. For high-value accounts (>$100/month), schedule a courtesy follow-up call after the first new bill

### 9. Escalation Path
1. If the system shows restrictions on billing cycle changes:
   - Escalate to Billing Team Lead for review
2. If the customer is dissatisfied with available options:
   - Escalate to Customer Retention Specialist
3. For system technical issues:
   - Create an IT support ticket and provide the customer with an estimated resolution timeframe

### 10. Quality Assurance
1. Complete the Billing Change Request Checklist in the CRM
2. Flag any unusual circumstances for supervisor review
3. Submit case for random quality assurance review if applicable
