# Billing Error Resolution Procedure for Telecom Customer Support

## Purpose
This procedure outlines the systematic approach for resolving billing errors reported by customers, ensuring accurate investigation, proper documentation, and timely resolution while maintaining compliance with company policies.

## Procedure

### Initial Customer Contact
1. Greet the customer professionally and acknowledge their billing concern
2. Verify the customer's identity using at least two authentication methods:
   - Account PIN/password
   - Last 4 digits of SSN/Tax ID
   - Recent transaction details
   - Security questions
3. Document the customer's specific billing complaint in the CRM system using the "Billing Dispute" category
4. Inform the customer of the expected resolution timeframe (typically 3-5 business days for standard issues)

### Investigation and Analysis
5. Review the customer's billing history for the past three billing cycles
6. Compare disputed charges against the customer's service plan and any promotions/discounts on the account
7. Verify usage data in the billing system matches what appears on the customer's bill
8. Check for recent account changes, plan modifications, or feature additions that might explain billing changes
9. Document all findings in the case notes with specific timestamps and system references

### Error Verification and Classification
10. Determine if an actual billing error exists based on the investigation
11. Classify the error type in the system:
    - System calculation error
    - Proration miscalculation
    - Promotion/discount not applied
    - Duplicate charge
    - Third-party billing error
    - Other (requires detailed description)
12. Calculate the exact financial impact of the error

### Resolution Implementation
13. For errors under $50:
    - Process immediate credit/adjustment
    - Document justification in the system
14. For errors between $50-$150:
    - Request supervisor approval via the billing adjustment queue
    - Provide complete documentation of findings
15. For errors exceeding $150:
    - Submit to billing department for review
    - Expect 3-5 business day review period
16. Apply the appropriate adjustment code in the billing system
17. Document the adjustment details including amount, reason code, and authorization ID

### Customer Communication
18. Contact the customer to explain the resolution (via their preferred contact method)
19. Explain when the adjustment will appear (current bill or next billing cycle)
20. Provide instructions for viewing the adjustment in their online account or mobile app
    - iOS: Navigate to Billing > Payment History > Adjustments
    - Android: Tap Account > Billing > View Adjustments
21. Offer to email a confirmation of the adjustment to the customer

### Follow-up and Prevention
22. Set a follow-up task in the CRM to verify the adjustment processed correctly
23. If the error affects multiple customers, submit an incident report to the Billing Operations team
24. For recurring error types, complete a "Billing Error Pattern" form for Quality Assurance review
25. Document any customer feedback about the resolution process

### Escalation Path
26. If unable to resolve within standard timeframes, escalate to:
    - Tier 1: Billing Team Lead (response within 4 hours)
    - Tier 2: Billing Operations Manager (response within 24 hours)
    - Tier 3: Finance Department (for systemic issues or amounts exceeding $500)
27. For escalations, provide complete case history and customer contact information
28. Update the customer every 48 hours on escalated cases

## Quality Assurance
All billing adjustments are subject to random quality review. Ensure all documentation is thorough and complies with company financial policies.
