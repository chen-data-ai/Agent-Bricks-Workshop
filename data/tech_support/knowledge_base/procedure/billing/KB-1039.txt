# Procedure: Handling Unexpected Charges Inquiries

## Purpose
This procedure guides customer support representatives through the process of investigating, explaining, and resolving unexpected charges on customer accounts while maintaining compliance with company policies and ensuring customer satisfaction.

## Procedure Steps

### Initial Assessment
1. Greet the customer professionally and acknowledge their concern about unexpected charges.
2. Verify the customer's identity using at least two authentication methods (account PIN, last 4 digits of SSN, billing address, or security questions).
3. Document the inquiry in the customer relationship management (CRM) system, creating a new case with category "Billing Inquiry - Unexpected Charges."
4. Ask the customer to specify which charges they are questioning and note their explanation.

### Investigation
5. Access the customer's billing history in the billing system and locate the specific charges in question.
6. Review the customer's service plan, add-ons, and recent account changes that might explain the charges.
7. Check for system notifications, rate changes, or promotional period expirations that may have affected the account.
8. Examine usage patterns (data, minutes, messages) that could have triggered overage charges.
9. Verify if any third-party charges appear on the bill and their authorization status.

### Explanation and Resolution
10. Provide a clear, jargon-free explanation of each charge to the customer.
11. If charges are legitimate:
    - Explain the source of the charges with reference to the customer's plan terms
    - Discuss options to prevent similar charges in the future
    - Offer to set up usage alerts through the mobile app (iOS/Android) or online account
12. If charges are erroneous:
    - Process an immediate adjustment for amounts under $50
    - Submit for supervisor approval for adjustments between $50-$150
    - Escalate to billing department for amounts exceeding $150
13. If charges are from third parties:
    - Explain the third-party billing process
    - Assist with disputing unauthorized charges
    - Offer to enable third-party billing blocks

### Documentation and Follow-up
14. Document all findings and explanations provided in the CRM case notes.
15. Summarize the resolution reached and any credits applied to the account.
16. Inform the customer of when adjustments will appear on their bill or account.
17. Send a confirmation email or SMS summarizing the discussion and resolution.
18. Schedule a follow-up if complex adjustments require processing time (typically 1-3 billing cycles).

### Escalation Path
19. Escalate to a supervisor if:
    - The customer remains dissatisfied after explanation
    - The adjustment amount exceeds your authorization threshold
    - The issue involves repeated billing errors
    - The situation involves potential fraud
20. For regulatory or legal concerns, escalate to the compliance team with complete documentation.

### Closing
21. Ask if the customer has questions about their current plan or if they would like to review plan options.
22. Confirm the customer understands the resolution and next steps.
23. Thank the customer for their patience and for bringing the matter to your attention.
24. Complete all case documentation before closing the interaction.

## Quality Assurance
All calls regarding unexpected charges are subject to quality review to ensure compliance with this procedure and to identify potential systemic billing issues.
