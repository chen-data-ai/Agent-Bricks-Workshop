# When is my payment due?

Your payment is due on the same date each month, as indicated on your monthly bill. This due date is typically 14-21 days after your bill is generated, giving you ample time to review your charges and make payment arrangements.

## Understanding your due date

Your specific payment due date is clearly marked on your bill in several places:
- At the top of your paper bill summary
- On the first page of your PDF bill (if you receive electronic bills)
- In your online account under "Billing Summary"
- In our mobile app under "Bill Details"

## What happens if I miss my due date?

If payment isn't received by the due date:
1. A late fee of $5 or 1.5% of the unpaid balance (whichever is greater) may be applied to your next bill
2. After 3 days past due, you may receive payment reminders via text or email
3. After 10 days past due, service restrictions may apply
4. After 30 days past due, service suspension may occur

## Payment options and timing

Different payment methods have different processing times:
- **Online/app payments**: Same-day processing if made before 8 PM ET
- **Phone payments**: Same-day processing if made before 6 PM ET
- **Mail payments**: Allow 5-7 business days for delivery and processing
- **In-store payments**: Processed immediately
- **Automatic payments**: Drafted on your due date (or 1-2 business days before)

## Changing your due date

If your current due date doesn't align well with your personal finances:
- You can request a one-time due date change through your online account
- Select a new date between the 1st and 28th of the month
- Changes typically take effect on your next billing cycle
- You're allowed one due date change every 12 months

## Common questions about due dates

**Q: Will I be notified before my payment is due?**
Yes! We send payment reminders 3-5 days before your due date via your preferred communication method (email, text, or app notification).

**Q: If I make a partial payment, will I still be charged a late fee?**
Yes. To avoid late fees, you must pay at least the "Minimum Payment Due" amount shown on your bill by the due date.

**Q: How does autopay work with my due date?**
With autopay, we'll automatically draft your payment on your due date (or 1-2 business days before, depending on your bank's processing time).
