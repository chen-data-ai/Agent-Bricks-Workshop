# How Will a Change to My Billing Cycle Affect My Account?

## Understanding Billing Cycle Changes

When your billing cycle changes, it means the date your bill is generated and when payment is due will shift to a new day of the month. This can happen if you make significant changes to your account (like adding new lines or switching plans) or upon your request for administrative purposes.

## What Happens During a Billing Cycle Change

### Your First Bill After the Change
Your first bill following a billing cycle change will typically be prorated, meaning you'll only be charged for the exact number of days of service you received. Here's how it works:

* **Partial Month Charges**: You'll see charges for the partial period between your old and new billing dates.
* **Credit for Unused Service**: If you've already paid for service days that fall after your new billing date, you'll receive a credit.

### Example Calculation:
Let's say your billing cycle currently runs from the 15th of each month to the 14th of the next month, and you're changing to a cycle that runs from the 1st to the end of each month:

* Your current plan costs $80/month
* Daily rate: $80 รท 30 days = approximately $2.67 per day
* If your new cycle starts on the 1st, you'll be charged for days 15-30/31 of the previous month (about $40-$43)
* Any unused days you already paid for will appear as a credit

## Impact on Your Plan Features

### Data Allowances
Your monthly data allowance will also be prorated during the transition month. For example:
* If you have a 15GB monthly data plan and your billing cycle is shortened to 15 days, you'll receive approximately 7.5GB for that shortened cycle.

### Unlimited Plans
Even with unlimited plans, any usage thresholds (like premium data limits or hotspot allowances) will be adjusted proportionally for the shorter or longer billing period.

## Managing Your Account During the Transition
