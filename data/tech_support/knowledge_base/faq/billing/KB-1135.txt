# How Can I Dispute a Charge on My Bill?

## Understanding Your Bill and Disputing Charges

If you notice an unexpected or incorrect charge on your monthly statement, you have the right to dispute it. Here's a comprehensive guide to help you understand and resolve billing concerns:

### Before Filing a Dispute

1. **Review your bill carefully**: Compare the charges against your plan details. Remember that your bill includes:
   - Base plan charges ($40-$120 depending on your tier)
   - Equipment installment payments (typically $20-$45 monthly)
   - One-time charges (activation fees, late payments)
   - Third-party charges (app purchases, subscriptions)
   - Taxes and regulatory fees

2. **Check for recent changes**: Did you recently upgrade your plan, add a line, or purchase accessories? These can affect your billing.

3. **Verify usage**: For usage-based charges (like international calls or data overages), check your actual usage in your online account or mobile app.

### How to Dispute a Charge

1. **Contact Customer Support**: The fastest resolution comes from calling our support line at the number on your bill or through the "Support" section of our mobile app (available on iOS and Android).

2. **Provide specific information**:
   - Your account number
   - The billing date in question
   - The specific charge(s) you're disputing
   - Why you believe the charge is incorrect

3. **Documentation helps**: Screenshots, receipts, or confirmation emails related to promotions or plan changes can help resolve your dispute faster.

### Common Disputed Charges and Explanations

- **Data overage charges**: If you see an additional $15 charge for data, you may have exceeded your plan limit. For example, our 10GB plan charges $15 per additional GB used.

- **Premium service charges**: Charges like "Premium SMS" or "Direct Carrier Billing" (typically $9.99-$19.99) indicate third-party subscriptions, which may have been authorized through app downloads or websites.

- **Proration charges**: When you change plans mid-billing cycle, you'll see partial charges for both plans. For example, if you upgrade from a $60 plan to an $80 plan halfway through your cycle, you might see: $30 (half month of old plan) + $40 (half month of new plan) = $70.

### What Happens After You Dispute

1. **Investigation period**: We'll investigate your dispute within 30 days.

2. **Temporary credit**: In some cases, we may issue a temporary credit while investigating.

3. **Resolution**: You'll receive notification of the outcome through your preferred contact method.

4. **Adjustment or explanation**: If we find the charge was incorrect, we'll adjust your bill. If the charge was valid, we'll provide a detailed explanation.

### Preventing Future Billing Surprises

- Set up usage alerts through our mobile app
- Review your plan details regularly
- Monitor third-party subscriptions
- Check for available promotions that might lower your bill
