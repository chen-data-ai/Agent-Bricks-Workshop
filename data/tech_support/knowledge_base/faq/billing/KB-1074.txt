# Why Am I Seeing Unexpected Charges on My Bill?

## Understanding Your Bill

If you've noticed charges on your bill that you weren't expecting, you're not alone. Many customers occasionally encounter charges they don't immediately recognize. Here's a comprehensive explanation of common unexpected charges and what they might mean.

### One-Time Charges

**Activation Fees:** When you start a new line of service, you may see a one-time activation fee of $30-$45 per line. This is typically disclosed during sign-up but can be easy to forget.

**Device Payments:** If you purchased a new phone on an installment plan, you'll see monthly device payments (typically for 24-36 months). For example, a $1,200 phone on a 36-month plan would appear as a $33.33 monthly charge.

**Upgrade Fees:** When upgrading to a new device, a one-time fee of $35-$40 may apply, even if you paid full price for the device.

### Proration and Billing Cycle Changes

**Proration Charges:** If you made changes to your plan mid-billing cycle, you might see partial charges for both your old and new plans. For example:
- If you upgraded from a $60 plan to an $80 plan halfway through your billing cycle, you might see a $30 credit for the unused half of your old plan and a $40 charge for the new plan's half-month of service.

**Billing Cycle Adjustments:** Sometimes your billing date changes, resulting in a longer billing period and consequently higher charges for that month.

### Usage-Based Charges

**Data Overage:** If you exceeded your data plan limit, you may see overage charges (typically $10-$15 per GB over your limit).

**International Usage:** Calls, texts, or data used while traveling internationally can incur significant charges:
- International calls from the US: $1-$3 per minute
- Data usage abroad: $5-$10 per day or $2-$10 per MB without a travel pass
- International texting: $0.25-$0.50 per message

**Premium Services:** Third-party charges for services like premium texting, apps, or subscriptions that bill through your carrier.

### Taxes and Regulatory Fees

**Government Taxes:** These vary by location but typically include state/local taxes and can account for 10-25% of your bill.

**Regulatory Fees:** These include:
- Universal Service Fund (USF): A federal fee that changes quarterly
- 911 Service Fee: Typically $0.75-$1.50 per line
- Administrative fees: Carrier-imposed fees to recover regulatory compliance costs
