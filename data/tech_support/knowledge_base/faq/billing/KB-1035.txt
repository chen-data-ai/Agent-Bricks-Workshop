# How Do Payment Arrangements Work?

## Overview
A payment arrangement allows you to pay your bill over time when you're unable to pay the full amount by the due date. This flexible option helps you avoid service interruption while managing temporary financial challenges.

## How to Set Up a Payment Arrangement

You can set up a payment arrangement through multiple channels:
- **Mobile App**: Tap the "Billing" section, select "Payment Options," then "Payment Arrangement"
- **Online Account**: Log in, navigate to "Billing," then "Payment Options"
- **Customer Service**: Call 1-800-XXX-XXXX (available 24/7)
- **Retail Store**: Visit any of our store locations during business hours

## Payment Arrangement Terms

Payment arrangements typically follow these guidelines:

| Account Status | Maximum Duration | Maximum Arrangements |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Good Standing | Up to 30 days   | 3 per 12 months     |
| Past Due (1-30 days) | Up to 14 days | 2 per 12 months |
| Past Due (31+ days) | Up to 7 days | 1 per 12 months |

## Example Calculation

If your current bill is $120 and you can only pay $50 now:
1. Initial payment: $50 (paid today)
2. Remaining balance: $70
3. You can arrange to pay the $70 in installments:
   - Option 1: Two payments of $35 (one week apart)
   - Option 2: One payment of $70 (due in two weeks)

## Late Fees and Payment Arrangements

Setting up a payment arrangement will pause additional late fees on the arranged amount, but:
- A one-time $5 arrangement fee may apply (waived for premium plan customers)
- Any portion of your bill not covered by the arrangement may still accrue late fees
- Missing a scheduled payment will void the arrangement and may result in immediate service interruption

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Will a payment arrangement affect my credit score?**
No, setting up a payment arrangement will not be reported to credit agencies. However, if you fail to complete the arrangement, the unpaid balance may eventually be reported.

**Can I modify my payment arrangement after it's set up?**
Yes, you can modify your arrangement once per billing cycle through your online account or by calling customer service.

**What happens if I miss a payment in my arrangement?**
Missing a payment may void your arrangement and could lead to service suspension. Contact us immediately if you anticipate missing a payment.

**Is there a limit to how many payment arrangements I can make?**
Yes, the number of arrangements available depends on your account standing (see table above).
