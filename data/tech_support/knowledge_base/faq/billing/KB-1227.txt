# What is the refund policy for charges on my bill?

When you see unexpected charges on your bill or need to request a refund, we want to make the process as straightforward as possible. Here's everything you need to know about our refund policy:

## General Refund Guidelines

* **Service Plan Charges**: Refunds for monthly service plans are prorated based on when you cancel. For example, if you cancel on the 15th day of a 30-day billing cycle, you'll receive approximately 50% of your monthly plan charge as a refund.

* **One-Time Charges**: Activation fees, upgrade fees, or other one-time charges may be eligible for refund within 14 days of the charge appearing on your bill.

* **Equipment Purchases**: Devices returned within our 30-day satisfaction guarantee period will be fully refunded, minus any restocking fees (typically $35 for phones and $15 for accessories).

* **Add-On Features**: Data add-ons, international passes, or premium features are refundable if unused. For example, if you purchased a $10 international calling package but didn't make any international calls, you can request a full refund.

## How Refunds Are Processed

Refunds are typically issued to your original payment method:
* Credit/debit card refunds: 3-5 business days
* Bank account refunds: 5-7 business days
* Bill credits: Applied to your next bill immediately

## Common Refund Scenarios

**Example 1:** If you were charged $15 for data overage but believe you were within your plan limits, we'll investigate your data usage. If we confirm the error, you'll receive the full $15 refund.

**Example 2:** If you upgraded to our Premium Plan ($75/month) from our Basic Plan ($50/month) but decide to revert back after 10 days in a 30-day cycle, you would receive approximately $25 (the difference between plans) ร (20 days รท 30 days) = $16.67 as a refund.
