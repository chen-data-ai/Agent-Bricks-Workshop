# When is my bill payment due?

Your bill payment is due by the date clearly marked as "Payment Due Date" on your monthly statement, typically 21-25 days after your billing cycle closes. This gives you adequate time to review your charges and arrange payment.

## Understanding Your Payment Timeline

- **Bill Generation Date**: Your billing cycle closes and we generate your statement
- **Bill Available Date**: Your bill becomes available online (1-2 days after generation)
- **Payment Due Date**: The date by which payment must be received to avoid late fees

For example, if your billing cycle ends on the 5th of each month, your bill might be generated on the 6th, available online by the 8th, and payment would be due around the 28th.

## Payment Options

You can pay your bill through multiple convenient channels:
- Our mobile app (available on iOS and Android)
- Online account portal at myaccount.ourcompany.com
- Automated phone system (800-555-1234)
- In-person at any of our retail locations
- By mail (allow 5-7 business days for processing)

## Late Payment Information

If payment isn't received by the due date:
- A late fee of $5 or 1.5% of the unpaid balance (whichever is greater) may be applied
- For example, on an unpaid balance of $100, the late fee would be $5
- On an unpaid balance of $400, the late fee would be $6 (1.5% of $400)
