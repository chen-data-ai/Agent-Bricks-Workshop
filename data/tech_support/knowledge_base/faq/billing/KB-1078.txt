# How do I set up autopay for my monthly bill?

Setting up autopay is a convenient way to ensure your bill is paid on time each month, helping you avoid late fees and service interruptions. Here's everything you need to know about our autopay service:

## How to Set Up Autopay

You can set up autopay through multiple channels:

**Mobile App (fastest method)**:
1. Download our app from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android)
2. Log in to your account
3. Tap "Billing" or "Payments"
4. Select "Autopay Settings" or "Payment Methods"
5. Choose your preferred payment method (credit/debit card or bank account)
6. Verify your information and tap "Enable Autopay"

**Customer Service**:

## Important Details About Autopay

- **Payment Timing**: Your payment will be automatically processed on your bill's due date, typically 15-20 days after your bill is generated.

- **Payment Methods**: We accept major credit/debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover) and direct bank account withdrawals.

- **Confirmation**: You'll receive an email confirmation when autopay is set up and another notification before each payment is processed.

- **Variable Billing**: If your bill amount varies (for example, if you have usage-based charges), autopay will withdraw the exact amount due each month. For instance, if your base plan is $70/month but you incur $15 in international calls, autopay will withdraw $85.

- **Insufficient Funds**: If your payment method has insufficient funds, we'll attempt to process the payment again within 48 hours. A failed payment fee of $25 may apply after multiple unsuccessful attempts.

## Managing Your Autopay

You can make changes to your autopay settings at any time:
- Update payment method
- Temporarily pause autopay
- Cancel autopay entirely

All changes must be made at least 2 business days before your payment due date to take effect for the current billing cycle.

## Common Questions About Autopay

**Q: Will I still receive a monthly bill?**  
Yes, you'll continue to receive your monthly bill via email or paper (based on your preferences) so you can review charges before payment is processed.

**Q: Can I set a maximum autopay amount?**  
Yes, you can set a maximum payment limit. If your bill exceeds this amount, you'll receive a notification and will need to approve the payment manually.

**Q: What if I want to dispute a charge?**  
If you notice an incorrect charge, contact customer service immediately. We can place a hold on specific charges while still processing autopay for the undisputed portion of your bill.

**Q: Is there a discount for using autopay?**  
Many of our plans offer a $5 monthly discount when you enroll in both autopay and paperless billing. This discount will appear as "Autopay & Paperless Discount" on your monthly statement.
