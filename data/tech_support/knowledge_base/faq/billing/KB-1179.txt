# What's the difference between prepaid and postpaid billing?

Prepaid and postpaid are two fundamentally different ways to pay for your mobile service, each with distinct advantages and billing processes.

## Prepaid Service

With prepaid service, you pay for your usage **before** you use it. Think of it as "pay-as-you-go."

**How prepaid billing works:**
- You purchase credit (or "top up") in advance
- Services are available until your balance depletes
- When your balance runs low, service stops until you add more funds
- No surprise bills or overage charges
- No credit check required to start service

**Example:** If you purchase a $40 prepaid plan on May 1st, you'll have service until May 31st. On June 1st, you'll need to make another payment to continue service.

**Common prepaid charges:**
- Base plan cost (e.g., $25/month for 5GB data + unlimited talk/text)
- Add-on packages (e.g., $5 for additional 1GB data)
- International calling credits

## Postpaid Service

With postpaid service, you use your services first and receive a bill at the end of your billing cycle.

**How postpaid billing works:**
- You sign up for a monthly plan with specific allowances
- You're billed regularly (typically monthly) for your base plan
- Any usage beyond your plan limits appears as additional charges
- Requires credit approval and often a contract
- Service continues even if you exceed your limits (resulting in overage charges)

**Example:** If your billing cycle runs from the 15th to the 14th of each month, you'll receive a bill after the 14th that includes your base plan cost plus any additional charges from the previous 30 days.

**Common postpaid charges:**
- Monthly plan fee (e.g., $70/month for unlimited data)
- Device installment payments (e.g., $25/month for 24 months)
- Overage fees (e.g., $15/GB for data beyond your limit)
- One-time fees (activation, late payment, etc.)
- Taxes and regulatory fees

## Managing Your Account

**For prepaid service:**
- Check your balance anytime in our mobile app (iOS and Android)
- Set up auto-pay to automatically top up when your balance gets low
- Purchase add-ons for additional data or international calling

**For postpaid service:**
- View and pay bills through our online account portal or mobile app
- Set up usage alerts to notify you when approaching limits
- Analyze your usage patterns to determine if you're on the right plan

## Which is right for you?

**Consider prepaid if you:**
- Want predictable costs with no surprise bills
- Prefer flexibility without contracts
- Have variable usage month-to-month
- Don't want to undergo a credit check

**Consider postpaid if you:**
- Want the latest devices with installment plans
- Have consistent, heavy usage
- Prefer not having to remember to top up
- Need family or multi-line discounts
