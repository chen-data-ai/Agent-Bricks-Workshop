# What's the difference between paper bills and electronic billing?

## Paper Bills vs. Electronic Billing Explained

**Paper bills** are traditional printed statements mailed to your home address each billing cycle, while **electronic billing (e-billing)** delivers your statement digitally to your email or through our mobile app and online account portal.

### Paper Bills
- Delivered by mail to your physical address
- Typically arrive 3-5 business days after the billing cycle closes
- Include a detailed breakdown of all charges, payments, and adjustments
- Incur a $2.99 monthly paper bill fee (waived for certain accessibility accommodations)
- Provide a physical record for your files
- Include return envelope for mailing payments

### Electronic Bills
- Instantly available when your billing cycle closes
- Accessible 24/7 through our mobile app (iOS and Android) and online account portal
- Contain the same detailed information as paper bills
- No additional fees for e-billing
- Environmentally friendly option
- Include convenient payment links for immediate payment
- Searchable format to easily find specific charges
- Access to up to 24 months of billing history

### Sample Bill Breakdown (Same for Both Formats)
Your bill will include:
- Account summary with total amount due and due date
- Base plan charges (e.g., $69.99 for Unlimited Premium)
- Device payment installments (e.g., $33.34/month for 24 months)
- Add-on services (e.g., $15 international calling package)
- One-time charges or credits
- Taxes and regulatory fees
- Usage details for non-unlimited services
