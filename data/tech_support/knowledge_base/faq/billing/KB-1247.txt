# How do I receive credit for a service interruption?

When you experience a service interruption, you may be eligible for a credit on your bill. We understand how frustrating service disruptions can be, and we're committed to fair compensation when they occur.

## How service interruption credits work

Service interruption credits are calculated based on:
- The duration of the outage
- The services affected
- Your monthly plan cost

For most interruptions lasting more than 24 consecutive hours, you'll automatically receive a prorated credit based on your monthly service charge. For example, if you experience a 2-day outage on a $60/month plan, you may receive approximately $4 credit (($60 ÷ 30 days) × 2 days).

## How to request a credit

1. **Automatic credits**: For widespread outages affecting your area, credits are typically applied automatically within 1-2 billing cycles.

2. **Report an issue**: If you experience a service disruption, report it immediately through:
   - Our mobile app (available for iOS and Android)
   - Your online account at myaccount.ourcompany.com
   - Customer service at 1-800-XXX-XXXX

3. **Credit review**: After reporting, our team will verify the outage and determine appropriate credit based on:
   - Confirmation of the service disruption in your area
   - The duration you were affected
   - Your specific service plan

## Credit examples by plan type

- **Basic plans ($30-$40/month)**: A 2-day outage typically results in $2-$2.70 credit
- **Standard plans ($50-$70/month)**: A 2-day outage typically results in $3.30-$4.70 credit
- **Premium plans ($80-$120/month)**: A 2-day outage typically results in $5.30-$8 credit

## Frequently asked questions

**When will I see the credit on my bill?**
Credits typically appear on your next bill, labeled as "Service Interruption Credit" or "Service Adjustment." You can view pending credits in your online account or mobile app.

**What if I don't receive my credit?**
If you don't see a credit within two billing cycles after a confirmed outage, please contact customer support with details about the outage dates and services affected.

**Are there interruptions that don't qualify for credits?**
Credits typically don't apply to:
- Scheduled maintenance (with advance notice)
- Outages lasting less than 24 hours
- Issues with your personal equipment
- Force majeure events (natural disasters, etc.)

**Can I track the status of my credit request?**
Yes! Log into your online account or mobile app and navigate to "Billing" → "Adjustment Requests" to check the status of any pending credits.
