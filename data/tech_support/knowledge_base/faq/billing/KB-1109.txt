# What is the refund policy for my bill?

When you request a refund for charges on your bill, our policy is designed to be fair while following industry regulations. Here's what you need to know:

## General Refund Guidelines

* **Service Plan Charges**: Refunds for monthly service plans are prorated based on the date of cancellation. For example, if you cancel on the 15th day of a 30-day billing cycle, you'll receive approximately 50% of your monthly plan charge as a refund.

* **One-time Charges**: Activation fees are refundable within 14 days of service activation. SIM card fees ($10-25 depending on type) are generally non-refundable once the package is opened.

* **Equipment Purchases**: Devices can be returned within 30 days with receipt and original packaging. A restocking fee of $35 for smartphones or $15 for basic phones may apply unless the device is defective.

## How Refunds Are Processed

Refunds are typically issued to your original payment method:
* Credit/debit card refunds: 3-5 business days
* Bank account refunds: 5-7 business days
* Bill credits: Applied to your next billing cycle

## Special Circumstances

* **Service Outages**: If you experienced a significant service outage (24+ hours), you may be eligible for a prorated credit. For example, a 2-day outage on a $60 monthly plan would result in a $4 credit ($60 ÷ 30 × 2).

* **Disputed Charges**: If you find unexpected charges on your bill, contact us within 60 days. We'll investigate and issue refunds for verified billing errors.

* **International Roaming**: Roaming charges can take up to 60 days to appear on your bill. Refund requests for these charges follow the same dispute process but may take longer to resolve.

## How to Request a Refund

You can request a refund through:
* Your online account (tap "Billing" → "Request Refund")
* Our mobile app (available for iOS and Android)
* Customer service at 1-800-XXX-XXXX
