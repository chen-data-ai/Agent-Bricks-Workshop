# Why am I seeing unexpected charges on my bill?

## Understanding unexpected charges on your monthly statement

It can be concerning to see charges you weren't expecting on your bill. Here's a comprehensive explanation of common unexpected charges and how to understand them:

### Common types of unexpected charges

**Prorated charges**: When you make changes to your service mid-billing cycle, you'll see partial charges or credits. For example, if you upgrade your data plan on the 15th day of a 30-day billing cycle, you'll be charged for half a month on your old plan and half a month on your new plan.

**One-time fees**: These include activation fees ($30-45 when starting new service), upgrade fees ($20-35 when getting a new device), or late payment fees (typically $5-10).

**Overage charges**: If you exceed your plan's limits, you'll incur additional costs:
- Data overages: Typically $10-15 per GB beyond your plan
- International usage: Calls ($1-3/minute), texts ($0.25-0.50 each), data ($2-10/MB)
- Premium services: Directory assistance ($1-2 per call)

**Third-party charges**: Sometimes called "cramming," these are charges from companies other than us for services like premium texting, apps, or digital subscriptions.

**Taxes and regulatory fees**: These vary by location but typically include:
- Federal Universal Service Fee
- State telecommunications taxes
- 911 service fees
- Regulatory cost recovery fees

### How to investigate your bill

1. **Compare with previous bills**: Look for new line items or increases in existing charges.

2. **Check recent account changes**: Did you recently:
   - Add a line?
   - Change your plan?
   - Travel internationally?
   - Purchase a new device?

3. **Review your usage**: Log into your online account or mobile app (available for iOS and Android) to see detailed usage information for each line.

### Example of prorated charges calculation

If you upgrade from a $50/month plan to an $80/month plan on day 20 of a 30-day billing cycle:
- $50 ÷ 30 days = $1.67 per day on old plan
- $1.67 × 20 days = $33.40 for days on old plan
- $80 ÷ 30 days = $2.67 per day on new plan
- $2.67 × 10 days = $26.70 for days on new plan
- Total: $60.10 for the month ($33.40 + $26.70)
