# What is our refund policy?

We understand that billing questions can arise, and we're committed to fair and transparent refund practices. Here's everything you need to know about our refund policy:

## General Refund Guidelines

* **Service Plan Charges**: Monthly service plan fees are typically non-refundable once the billing cycle has begun. However, if you cancel service within the first 14 days of a new activation (our Satisfaction Guarantee period), we'll refund your plan charges.

* **Prorated Refunds**: If you downgrade or cancel your service mid-billing cycle, you may receive a prorated refund for the unused portion. For example, if you have a $60 monthly plan and downgrade halfway through your billing cycle, you could receive approximately $30 back.

* **Equipment Returns**: Devices returned within 14 days of purchase will be refunded in full, minus a $35 restocking fee. The device must be in like-new condition with all original packaging and accessories.

## Billing Error Refunds

If you identify an error on your bill (such as being charged for services you didn't request), we'll investigate within 5 business days. Verified billing errors will be refunded to your original payment method within 1-2 billing cycles.

**Example**: If you were incorrectly charged $9.99 for a premium service you didn't subscribe to, we would refund the full $9.99 plus any applicable taxes.

## Processing Timeframes

* **Credit/Debit Card Refunds**: 3-5 business days
* **Bank Account Refunds**: 5-7 business days
* **Bill Credits**: Applied to your next billing cycle

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I get a refund if I experience service outages?**
A: For verified service outages exceeding 24 hours, we provide credits proportional to the outage duration. For example, a 2-day outage on a $60 monthly plan would result in a $4 credit ([$60 รท 30] ร 2).

**Q: What if I accidentally purchased the wrong plan?**
A: If you select the wrong plan, contact us within 24 hours, and we'll switch you to the correct plan with no penalty fees.

**Q: How do refunds work for international roaming charges?**
A: Disputed international roaming charges require investigation with our partner carriers. This process typically takes 15-30 days, after which eligible refunds will be processed.
