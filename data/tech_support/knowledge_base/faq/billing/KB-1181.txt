# Why are there taxes and regulatory fees on my bill?

Your monthly bill includes various taxes and regulatory fees that we're required by law to collect and remit to federal, state, and local governments. These charges aren't part of our revenue and vary based on your location, service type, and current regulations.

## Common taxes and fees you might see:

**Federal Universal Service Fund (FUSF)** - This fee supports providing telecommunications services to rural areas, schools, libraries, and low-income consumers. The rate is adjusted quarterly by the FCC and is currently calculated as approximately 28.9% of interstate and international calls.

**State and Local Taxes** - These vary significantly by location and may include:
- State telecommunications excise tax (typically 3-7%)
- Local utility taxes (often 1-5%)
- 911 emergency services fees (usually $0.50-$2.00 per line)
- State universal service fees (varies by state)

**Regulatory Cost Recovery Fee** - This helps us recover costs associated with complying with government regulations. For most plans, this ranges from $1.50 to $3.25 per line.

**Administrative Fee** - This fee helps cover costs related to cell site maintenance, interconnection between carriers, and property taxes. Typically $1.99-$3.99 per line.

## Example calculation:

For a customer in Colorado with a $70 monthly plan and one line:
- Base plan: $70.00
- Federal Universal Service Fund (28.9% of applicable charges): ~$3.25
- Colorado Telecommunications Relay Service: $0.10
- 911 fee: $1.50
- State sales tax (2.9%): $2.03
- Local city tax (3.5%): $2.45
- Regulatory Cost Recovery Fee: $1.99
- Administrative Fee: $2.99
- **Total bill: $84.31**

## Frequently asked questions:
