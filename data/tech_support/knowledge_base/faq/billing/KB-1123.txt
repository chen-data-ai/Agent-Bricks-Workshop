# What payment options are available for my monthly bill?

We offer several convenient ways to pay your monthly bill:

## Online Payment Options
* **My Account Portal**: Log in at myaccount.ourcompany.com or use our mobile app (available for iOS and Android) to make one-time payments or set up autopay
* **Text-to-Pay**: Text "PAY" to 87654 to receive a secure payment link
* **Payment by Phone**: Call our automated system at 1-800-555-1234 (toll-free, available 24/7)

## In-Person Payment Options
* **Retail Stores**: Visit any of our store locations (find the nearest one using our Store Locator in the mobile app)
* **Authorized Payment Centers**: Including most major grocery stores and check-cashing locations (may charge a processing fee of $2-$5)

## By Mail
Send checks or money orders (not cash) to:
```
Our Telecom Company
P.O. Box 12345
Anytown, ST 12345
```
Please include your account number on your check and allow 5-7 business days for processing.

## Autopay Options
Set up automatic payments through:
* Credit/debit card (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover)
* Bank account (checking or savings)
* Digital wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal)

Autopay can be scheduled for your due date or up to 5 days before. You'll still receive your bill 15-20 days before payment is processed.

## Important Notes:
* **Late Payment Fee**: $10 or 1.5% of unpaid balance (whichever is greater) applies to payments received after the due date
* **Payment Processing**: Online and phone payments typically post within 24 hours; in-store payments post immediately; mailed payments may take 5-7 business days
* **Partial Payments**: You can make partial payments, but any remaining balance must be paid by the due date to avoid late fees

Need to discuss a payment arrangement or have questions about your bill? Contact our customer service team at 1-800-555-5678 or chat with us through the mobile app.
