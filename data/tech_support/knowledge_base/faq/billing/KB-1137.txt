# How Does Family Plan Billing Work?

Family plans allow multiple lines to share a single account with potential savings compared to individual plans. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of how family plan billing works:

## Basic Structure

Your monthly bill consists of:
- Base plan charge (covers the primary line and shared features)
- Per-line access fees (for each additional line)
- Any add-ons or premium features
- Taxes and regulatory fees

## Example Calculation

For our Popular Family Share plan with 4 lines:
- Base plan: $70/month (includes 1st line and 30GB shared data)
- Additional lines: $20 each × 3 lines = $60
- Total before taxes/fees: $130/month

This averages to $32.50 per line compared to $60 for a single-line plan with similar features.

## Common Billing Questions

**How is data usage billed?**
Data is shared from a common pool. If your family has a 30GB plan, all lines draw from this total. You can monitor individual usage in our mobile app under "Account" → "Data Usage."

**What happens if we exceed our data limit?**
Depending on your plan, you'll either:
- Experience reduced speeds (throttling) until the next billing cycle
- Automatically receive data add-ons ($15 per 2GB on most plans)
- Have unlimited data with premium speeds up to a threshold, then reduced speeds

**Can I set usage limits for individual lines?**
Yes! Through our mobile app (iOS and Android), you can:
- Set data usage alerts
- Implement spending caps
- Restrict premium content purchases
- Limit international calling/texting

**How are one-time purchases billed?**
Any premium content, international calls, or other one-time charges appear as separate line items on your bill, clearly labeled with the responsible line number.

## Managing Your Family Plan
