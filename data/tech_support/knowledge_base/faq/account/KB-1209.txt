# How do I manage my account PIN and passwords?

## Account Security Overview

Your account PIN and passwords are critical security measures that protect your personal information and prevent unauthorized changes to your services. This guide explains how to manage these credentials effectively.

## Account PIN

### What is my account PIN?
Your account PIN is a 4-6 digit number that serves as a verbal password when contacting our customer service representatives. This PIN is required for account verification before discussing account details or making changes to your services.

### How to set up or change your account PIN:
1. **Online**: Log in to your account at [myaccount.company.com](https://myaccount.company.com) or through our mobile app (available on iOS and Android), navigate to "Account Settings" > "Security" > "Change PIN"
2. **Phone**: Call customer service at 1-800-XXX-XXXX and request a PIN change (current PIN required for verification)
3. **In-store**: Visit any retail location with a government-issued photo ID

### Verification requirements:
- For online changes: Your account password and possibly a one-time verification code sent to your registered mobile number or email
- For phone changes: Your current PIN, last 4 digits of SSN, and billing address verification
- For in-store changes: Government-issued photo ID matching the account holder's name
