# What are the requirements for porting my number to another carrier?

When you decide to transfer your phone number to a different service provider (known as "porting out"), there are several important requirements and procedures to be aware of:

## Verification Requirements

* **Account Information**: You'll need to provide your new carrier with:
  - The phone number you wish to port
  - Your full name as it appears on your current account
  - Your account number (found on your bill or in your online account)
  - Your account PIN or password
  - The billing address associated with your account

* **Account Standing**: Your account must be active and in good standing with no past-due balances to complete a port-out.

* **Identity Verification**: For security purposes, we may contact you to verify your port-out request before approving the transfer.

## Timeframes

* **Mobile Numbers**: Typically complete within 1-3 business days after all information is correctly submitted.
* **Landline Numbers**: May take 3-10 business days to complete.
* **Port-Out Validation**: Initial validation of your request usually occurs within 24 hours.

You can check your port status through our mobile app (available on iOS and Android) or by logging into your online account.

## Billing and Service Impacts

* **Final Bill**: You'll receive a final bill from us after the port is complete, which may include:
  - Any remaining device payments
  - Early termination fees (if applicable)
  - Prorated service charges up to the port completion date

* **Service Continuity**: To minimize service interruption, we recommend:
  - Not canceling your service with us before the port is complete
  - Having your new device/SIM activated and ready
  - Initiating ports during business hours when support teams are available

* **Automatic Cancellation**: Once your number is successfully ported out, your service with us for that line will automatically cancel.

* **Additional Services**: Any additional services tied to your phone number (voicemail, text messaging) will also transfer to your new carrier.

If you need assistance with a port-out request or have questions about the process, please contact our Customer Support team through the mobile app, online chat, or by calling the number on your bill.
