# How Do I Transfer Billing Responsibility for My Account to Someone Else?

## Overview
Transferring billing responsibility allows you to shift financial ownership of your account to another person while maintaining the same phone numbers and services. This process, also known as a Transfer of Responsibility (TOR), requires verification from both parties and careful consideration of billing impacts.

## Eligibility Requirements
- The account must be in good standing with no past-due balance
- Both parties must be at least 18 years old and pass a credit check
- The current account holder must authorize the transfer
- The new account holder must accept responsibility for the account

## Transfer Process
1. **Initiate the transfer**: The current account holder must start the process either:
   - Through the mobile app: Navigate to Account → Settings → Transfer Responsibility
   - Online: Log in to your account dashboard and select "Transfer Billing Responsibility" under Account Management
   - By phone: Contact Customer Support at 1-800-XXX-XXXX

2. **Verification required**:
   - Current account holder: Account PIN, last 4 digits of SSN, and government-issued photo ID
   - New account holder: Full name, email address, SSN, date of birth, and government-issued photo ID

3. **Agreement review**: Both parties will receive the Transfer Agreement via email that must be digitally signed within 7 days

## Timeframes
- Online/app transfers typically process within 24-48 hours after both parties complete verification
- Phone-initiated transfers may take 3-5 business days
- If the new account holder fails credit verification, you'll be notified within 24 hours

## Billing and Service Impacts
- The billing cycle may reset on the transfer date
- A prorated final bill will be issued to the current account holder
- The new account holder may need to select a new rate plan if the current plan is no longer available
- Service features like autopay, paperless billing, and authorized users will need to be re-established
- Device payment plans will transfer to the new account holder's responsibility

## Important Considerations
- Promotional discounts may not transfer to the new account
- The new account holder may be subject to a credit check which could affect deposit requirements
- Family plans require all lines to transfer together unless individual lines are moved to separate accounts first

For additional assistance, contact Customer Support or visit your nearest retail store with both parties present and proper identification.
