# What happens during an account suspension and how can I reinstate my service?

## Account Suspension Process

When your account is suspended, your service is temporarily disabled but your account remains active in our system. This typically occurs due to non-payment, violation of our Acceptable Use Policy, or at your request (voluntary suspension).

### Types of Suspensions

1. **Payment-Related Suspension**
   - Occurs when payment is not received by the due date plus the grace period (typically 7 days)
   - Limited functionality remains (ability to receive incoming calls and make emergency calls only)
   - Late payment fees may apply ($15 per line)

2. **Policy Violation Suspension**
   - Occurs when our systems detect unusual usage patterns or violations of our Terms of Service
   - Service is completely restricted until the issue is resolved
   - No fees are charged if the investigation determines no violation occurred

3. **Voluntary Suspension**
   - Available once per 12-month period for up to 90 days
   - Reduced monthly fee applies ($10 per line)
   - All services are paused but your number is reserved

### Verification Requirements

To reinstate service, we require:
- Account owner verification (last 4 digits of SSN or Tax ID)
- Photo ID if reinstating in-store
- Security PIN if reinstating via phone support
- Account password if reinstating through the mobile app or online portal

### Timeframes

- **Payment-related suspensions**: Service typically restores within 1 hour of payment receipt
- **Policy violation suspensions**: 24-48 hours after resolution of the issue
- **Voluntary suspensions**: Service restores on the scheduled end date or within 2 hours of your reinstatement request

### Billing Impact

- Your billing cycle remains unchanged during suspension
- For involuntary suspensions, full charges apply during the suspended period
- For voluntary suspensions, reduced monthly charges apply
- Any service credits or promotions may be paused during suspension periods

### How to Reinstate Service

1. **Via Mobile App** (fastest method):
   - Log in to our mobile app (iOS/Android)
   - Navigate to "Account" → "Service Status"
   - Select "Reinstate Service" and follow the prompts

2. **Online Account Management**:
   - Visit our website and log in to your account
   - Go to "Account Settings" → "Service Management"
   - Choose "Reinstate Suspended Service"

3. **Customer Support**:
   - Call 1-800-XXX-XXXX
   - Provide required verification information
   - Request service reinstatement

**Note**: Multiple suspensions within a 12-month period may result in a reinstatement fee ($25) and could affect your account standing or eligibility for certain promotions.
