# How do I add a new line to my existing account?

## Overview
Adding a new line to your existing account allows you to bring a new device or user onto your current plan. This process can typically be completed through multiple channels including online, via our mobile app, or at a retail location.

## Adding a Line Online or Through Our Mobile App

1. **Sign in to your account**
   * Website: Visit our official website and log in with your username and password
   * Mobile app: Open our app on iOS or Android and sign in to your account

2. **Navigate to account management**
   * Select "Manage Plan" or "Account Settings" from the dashboard
   * Choose "Add a line" from the available options

3. **Verification requirements**
   * You'll need to verify your identity as the primary account holder using:
     - Last 4 digits of your Social Security Number
     - Account PIN/password
     - Possible two-factor authentication via text or email

4. **Select your options**
   * Choose whether you're adding a line with:
     - A new device purchase
     - Bringing your own device (BYOD)
     - Just a SIM card for an existing device

5. **Complete the setup process**
   * Select a plan for the new line (same as existing lines or different)
   * Add any features or international options if needed
   * Review and confirm all charges

## Timeframes and Service Activation

* **Online/app activation**: New lines are typically activated within 30 minutes to 2 hours
* **In-store activation**: Usually immediate when completed at a retail location
* **Shipping timeframes**: If ordering a new device, standard shipping takes 2-3 business days; expedited options are available

## Billing Impact

* **Prorated charges**: Your next bill will include prorated charges for the new line from the activation date to the end of your billing cycle
* **Plan changes**: Adding a line may qualify you for multi-line discounts or require a plan change to accommodate the additional line
* **One-time fees**: Be aware of potential one-time charges including:
  - Activation fee ($20-$40 depending on current promotions)
  - SIM card fee (typically $10-$25)
  - Device down payment (if applicable)

## Important Considerations

* **Credit check**: A credit check may be required when adding certain types of lines
* **Account limits**: Standard accounts can have up to 10 voice lines (limits may vary based on your specific plan)
* **Contract implications**: Adding a line may initiate a new agreement term for that specific line
* **Family controls**: If adding a line for a child or dependent, parental controls can be set up during or after activation
