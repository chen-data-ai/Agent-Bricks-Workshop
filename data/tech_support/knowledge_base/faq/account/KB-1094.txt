# What are the requirements for porting my number to another carrier?

## Port-Out Requirements and Process

When you request to transfer your phone number from our network to another service provider (known as a "port-out"), certain requirements must be met to ensure a smooth transition and protect your account security.

### Verification Requirements

To initiate a port-out, you'll need to provide the following to your new carrier:
- Account number (found on your monthly bill or in your online account)
- Account PIN/password
- The phone number(s) you wish to port
- Name of the primary account holder
- Billing address associated with your account

**Important:** For security purposes, we verify that the information provided to the new carrier exactly matches what's in our records. Even minor discrepancies can cause port-out delays.

### Authorization Process

1. **Request verification:** We'll send a one-time verification code to your device or email address on file
2. **Identity confirmation:** You may be asked to provide a government-issued ID if the port request is made in-store
3. **Account standing verification:** Your account must be in good standing with no past-due balance

### Timeframes

- **Simple ports** (single line, residential accounts): Typically completed within 24-48 hours
- **Complex ports** (business accounts, multiple lines): May take 3-5 business days
- **Emergency ports:** Contact Customer Support directly at 1-800-XXX-XXXX for expedited processing

You can track your port status through our mobile app (iOS and Android) or your online account portal.

### Billing and Service Impacts

- Your service with us remains active until the port is complete
- Final bill will be prorated to the completion date of the port
- Any contract termination fees will apply if you're still within your agreement period
- Equipment installment plans must be paid in full upon port completion
- Autopay settings will need to be canceled manually through your online account

### Additional Considerations

- Port requests submitted after 7 PM or on weekends/holidays will begin processing the next business day
- If you have bundled services (internet, TV), porting your phone number will not affect these services
- To protect against unauthorized ports, consider adding Port Freeze protection through your online account or our mobile app

For assistance with port-out requests, contact our Port Center at 1-800-XXX-XXXX or use the "Transfer My Number" section in our mobile app.
