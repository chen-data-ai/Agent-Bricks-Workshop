## Data Protection Measures

Your personal information is protected through:

* **Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted both during transmission and when stored in our systems

* **Regular security audits**: We conduct ongoing assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities
* **Compliance**: Our practices adhere to telecommunications industry standards and relevant data protection regulations

## Managing Your Privacy Settings

You can review and adjust your privacy preferences through:

**Mobile App**:

**Online Account**:

## Verification Requirements

For privacy-related changes, we require:

* **Standard changes** (marketing preferences): Account password only
* **Enhanced privacy requests** (data deletion): Two-factor authentication via SMS or email
* **Complete data requests**: Government-issued ID verification may be required for comprehensive personal data reports

## Implementation Timeframes

* Marketing preference changes: Immediate effect

## Impact on Services

Please note:
* Opting out of certain data sharing may limit personalized offers and recommendations
* Some data collection is necessary for essential service functionality (billing, network optimization)
* Privacy settings do not affect your core telecommunications services or billing amounts
* Deleting certain account data may reset your preferences for services like voicemail or parental controls
