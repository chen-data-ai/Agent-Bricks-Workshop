# How do I manage multiple lines on my account?

## Overview
Managing multiple lines on your account allows you to control all your family or business connections from a single account. As the primary account holder, you can add, remove, or modify lines, adjust service plans, and monitor usage across all lines.

## Account Access & Verification
To manage multiple lines, you'll need:
- Primary account holder credentials (username/password)
- Account PIN or last 4 digits of SSN for verification
- Government-issued photo ID for in-store changes
- Two-factor authentication completion when prompted

For security reasons, only the primary account holder can make significant changes to the account structure. Authorized users can only manage their assigned line unless specifically granted additional permissions.

## Adding New Lines
1. Log into your account via our mobile app (available on iOS and Android) or website
2. Navigate to "Account" → "Manage Lines" → "Add a Line"
3. Select the desired plan for the new line
4. Complete identity verification if required
5. Choose a new device or select "Bring Your Own Device"
6. Follow the prompts to complete setup

New lines typically activate within 30 minutes to 2 hours. Expedited activation is available in-store.

## Removing Lines
1. Access your account through any supported channel
2. Select "Manage Lines" and choose the line to remove
3. Select "Remove Line" and confirm your decision
4. Return any leased equipment if applicable

**Important:** Line removals take effect at the end of your current billing cycle unless otherwise specified. Early termination fees may apply for lines under contract.

## Billing Considerations
- Adding lines mid-cycle typically results in prorated charges
- Plan changes may trigger immediate billing adjustments
- Family/shared plans may offer discounts for multiple lines
- Data usage limits apply collectively to shared plans
- Individual line usage details are viewable in your account dashboard

## Service Impacts
When modifying multiple lines, be aware that:
- Number transfers (ports) may take 1-3 business days to complete
- Service interruptions are possible during line transfers (typically less than 30 minutes)
- Device payment plans remain active even if lines are removed
- Promotional discounts may be affected by line changes

## Managing Line-Specific Features
Each line on your account can have customized:
- Data caps and usage alerts
- Content filters and parental controls
- International calling/roaming options
- Premium service subscriptions

Access these options by selecting the specific line in your account dashboard and navigating to "Line Settings."
