# How Do I Change the Primary Account Holder on My Account?

## Overview
Changing the primary account holder transfers account ownership and responsibility to another person. This process requires specific documentation and verification steps to protect your account security.

## Requirements for Primary Account Holder Changes

To change the primary account holder, you'll need:

* Government-issued photo ID for both current and new account holders
* The last 4 digits of the current account holder's Social Security Number
* Account PIN/password
* Completed Account Transfer Authorization form (available in our mobile app or online account portal)
* Both parties must consent to the transfer

## Process Steps

1. **Initiate the request** through one of these methods:
   * In our mobile app: Navigate to Account → Settings → Account Ownership
   * Online: Log in to My Account portal and select "Transfer Account Ownership"
   * Visit a retail store with both parties present
   * Call Customer Support at 1-800-XXX-XXXX

2. **Verification process**:
   * The current account holder must verify their identity
   * The new account holder must pass a credit check (if applicable)
   * Both parties must e-sign the transfer agreement

3. **Documentation submission**:
   * Upload required documents through the app/website or
   * Present documents in-store or
   * Email documents to accounttransfers@provider.com

## Timeframes

* **In-store transfers**: Can typically be completed same-day
* **Online/app transfers**: 1-3 business days for processing
* **Phone-initiated transfers**: 3-5 business days for processing

## Impact on Services and Billing

* The new account holder assumes financial responsibility for all charges
* Existing autopay settings will be canceled and need to be re-established
* The billing cycle date may change
* Contract terms remain in effect and transfer to the new account holder
* Device payment plans will transfer to the new account holder
* Loyalty rewards and account history will transfer to the new account holder

## Special Considerations

* **For Android users**: You may need to re-sync your Google Play account for purchased content
* **For iOS users**: App Store purchases will remain tied to the original Apple ID
* **Family plans**: Line ownership will transfer but individual line users remain unchanged
* **Business to consumer transfers**: Additional documentation may be required

## Restrictions

* Accounts with past-due balances must be brought current before transfer
* Accounts in collections cannot be transferred
* Promotional pricing may be affected by ownership changes
