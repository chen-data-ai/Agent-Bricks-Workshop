# How Do I Merge Multiple Accounts Under My Name?

## Overview
You can request to merge multiple telecom accounts under your name to simplify billing and management. This process combines separate accounts into a single account while maintaining all services.

## Eligibility Requirements
- You must be the primary account holder on all accounts being merged
- All accounts must be in good standing with no past-due balances
- Accounts must be under the same legal name and tax ID/SSN
- Business and personal accounts cannot be merged together

## Verification Process
To protect your security, we require comprehensive verification:
- Government-issued photo ID (driver's license, passport, or state ID)
- The last 4 digits of your SSN or full Tax ID for business accounts
- Account PINs/passwords for all accounts being merged
- Verification of authorized users on each account (if applicable)

## Step-by-Step Process
1. **Initiate request**: Contact Customer Support through our mobile app, online account portal, or by calling 1-800-XXX-XXXX
2. **Verification**: Complete identity verification for all accounts
3. **Account review**: Our team will review your accounts for eligibility
4. **Confirmation**: You'll receive a merger agreement outlining all terms
5. **Approval**: Digitally sign the agreement through our secure portal
6. **Implementation**: Technical merger of accounts begins

## Timeframes
- Initial verification: 1-2 business days
- Account review: 2-3 business days
- Implementation: 3-5 business days after approval
- Total process: Typically 7-10 business days

## Billing Impact
- Your billing cycle may change to align all services
- A prorated final bill will be generated for closed accounts
- Any autopay settings must be reconfigured on the new merged account
- Existing promotions and discounts will transfer to the new account

## Service Impact
- No service interruption during the merger process
- Device payment plans will transfer with their current terms
- Phone numbers remain unchanged
- Service addresses may need verification in our system

## Managing Your New Account
After merger completion, you can manage all services through:
- Our mobile app (iOS and Android)
- Online account portal at www.ourcompany.com/myaccount
- Customer service at 1-800-XXX-XXXX

## Important Notes
- Account mergers cannot be partially reversed
- You'll receive a new account number for the merged account
- Save your final bills from previous accounts for your records
- Update any third-party payment services with your new account information
