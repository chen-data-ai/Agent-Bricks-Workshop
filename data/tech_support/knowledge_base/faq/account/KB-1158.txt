# How Do I Transfer Billing Responsibility for My Account to Someone Else?

## Overview
Transferring billing responsibility allows you to shift financial and legal ownership of your telecom account to another individual. This process, also known as a Transfer of Ownership (TOO) or Assumption of Liability (AOL), requires specific steps to ensure a smooth transition.

## Eligibility Requirements
Before initiating a transfer:
- Your account must be in good standing with no past-due balances
- The person assuming responsibility must pass a credit check
- Both parties must provide valid government-issued photo ID
- Both parties must agree to the terms of the transfer

## Transfer Process
1. **Initiation**: The current account owner must initiate the transfer request through one of these methods:
   - Online: Log into your account via our website or mobile app (available on iOS and Android)
   - Phone: Contact Customer Support at 1-800-XXX-XXXX
   - In-store: Visit any of our retail locations with both parties present

2. **Verification**: Both parties must complete identity verification:
   - Current owner: Account PIN/password and last 4 digits of SSN
   - New owner: Full name, address, SSN, and date of birth for credit check

3. **Agreement**: Both parties must review and accept the transfer agreement, which outlines:
   - Financial responsibility transition
   - Service plan terms and conditions
   - Any applicable fees

## Timeframes
- **Processing time**: 24-48 hours for system processing after approval
- **Billing cycle impact**: Changes typically take effect at the start of the next billing cycle
- **Service continuation**: Service remains uninterrupted during the transfer

## Billing Impacts
- **Final bill**: Current owner receives a prorated final bill through the transfer date
- **First bill**: New owner's first bill begins on the transfer completion date
- **Deposits**: Any existing deposits may be refunded to the original account holder or transferred to the new account

## Service Impacts
- **Phone numbers**: All numbers on the account transfer to the new owner
- **Device payments**: Any remaining device payment plans transfer to the new owner
- **Plan features**: Current plan features and promotions may change based on new owner eligibility

## Important Considerations
- Authorized users will need to be re-established by the new account owner
- Auto-pay settings will not transfer and must be set up again
- Mobile app access will need to be reconfigured with the new account credentials
- The new owner may need to establish new security questions and PIN
