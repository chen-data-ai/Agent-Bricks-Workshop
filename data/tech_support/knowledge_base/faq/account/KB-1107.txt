# How do I add or remove authorized users on my account?

## Adding Authorized Users

Authorized users are individuals you designate to make changes to your account, including purchasing new devices, changing service plans, or accessing account information. Here's how to manage authorized users:

### Adding an Authorized User
1. **Online Management**: 
   - Log into your account via our website or mobile app (available on iOS and Android)
   - Navigate to "Account Settings" > "Account Users" > "Add Authorized User"
   - Complete the required information form

2. **Verification Requirements**:
   - The account owner must provide their PIN/password
   - The new authorized user's full legal name
   - Their date of birth
   - Last 4 digits of their Social Security Number (for identity verification)
   - Contact phone number and email address

3. **Permission Levels**:
   You can customize access levels for each authorized user:
   - Full access (equivalent to account owner)
   - Billing access only
   - Technical support access only
   - View-only access

## Removing Authorized Users

1. **Removal Process**:
   - Log into your account via website or mobile app
   - Go to "Account Settings" > "Account Users"
   - Select the user you wish to remove
   - Click "Remove User" and confirm your decision

2. **In-Store or Phone Support**:
   Authorized users can also be added or removed by visiting a retail store or calling Customer Care at 1-800-XXX-XXXX. The account owner must be present or on the call with:
   - Government-issued photo ID
   - Account PIN/password

## Important Information

- **Processing Time**: Changes to authorized users typically take effect immediately online, but may take 24-48 hours to fully propagate across all systems.

- **Billing Impact**: Authorized users cannot change the billing address or payment method unless granted full access permissions.

- **Service Impact**: When an authorized user is removed, any device upgrades or plan changes they initiated will remain in effect. Their removal does not cancel any services or orders they placed.

- **Security Considerations**: All authorized users can access sensitive account information. We recommend:
   - Only adding trusted individuals
   - Regularly reviewing the list of authorized users
   - Changing your account PIN when removing users
   - Enabling notifications for account changes

- **Business Accounts**: Corporate accounts have different authorized user management procedures. Please contact your Business Account Manager for details.

If you need additional assistance managing authorized users, please contact Customer Care or visit your nearest retail location.
