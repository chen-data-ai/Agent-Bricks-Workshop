# How Do I Manage Multiple Lines on My Account?

## Managing Your Multi-Line Account

Managing multiple lines on your account allows you to control phone numbers for family members or employees under a single billing account. As the primary account holder, you have several options for managing these lines efficiently.

### Access Options for Multi-Line Management

You can manage your multiple lines through:

- **Mobile App**: The most convenient option available 24/7 on iOS and Android devices
- **Online Account Portal**: Complete management tools at myaccount.provider.com
- **Customer Care**: Call 1-800-XXX-XXXX for assisted service (Monday-Saturday, 8AM-9PM)
- **Retail Locations**: In-person support with proper identification

### Verification Requirements

For security purposes, the following verification is required when making changes to multi-line accounts:

- **Primary Account Holder**: Government-issued photo ID and account PIN
- **Authorized Users**: Must be listed on the account with their own PIN
- **Online/App Changes**: Secure login plus two-factor authentication
- **Major Account Changes**: May require the primary account holder's presence regardless of who initiates the request

### Common Multi-Line Management Functions

**Adding a New Line**
- Processing time: 1-2 hours for activation
- Requires credit check for new lines (unless prepaid)
- May adjust your billing cycle date
- New lines prorated to your existing bill cycle

**Removing a Line**
- Takes effect at the end of the current billing cycle
- Early termination fees may apply for lines under contract
- Device payment plans must be paid in full or transferred

**Transferring Line Ownership**
- Requires consent from both parties
- Credit check required for the receiving account
- Processing time: 24-48 hours
- May result in number transfer fees ($20 per line)

**Setting Line-Specific Controls**
- Data usage limits can be set per line
- Content filters and purchase authorizations
- Time-of-day usage restrictions
- Changes take effect within 15 minutes

### Billing Considerations

- Adding/removing lines may change plan eligibility and pricing
- Multi-line discounts typically apply to 2+ lines (saving $5-$25 per line)
- Data sharing pools adjust automatically when lines are added/removed
- Mid-cycle changes are prorated on your next bill

### Troubleshooting Tips

If changes aren't appearing across all lines:
1. Allow up to 4 hours for system updates
2. Restart devices on affected lines
3. Verify changes in your online account or mobile app
4. Contact Customer Care if issues persist after 24 hours

For immediate assistance with multi-line management, chat with a representative through the mobile app or call Customer Care.
