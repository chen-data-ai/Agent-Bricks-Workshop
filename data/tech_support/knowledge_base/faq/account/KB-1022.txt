# How do I manage my account PIN and passwords?

## Account Security Overview

Your account PIN and passwords are essential security measures that protect your personal information and prevent unauthorized changes to your account. Different credentials serve different purposes within our systems.

## Types of Security Credentials

**Account PIN**: A 4-6 digit number required for account verification when contacting customer service, making account changes in-store, or performing certain high-security transactions.

**Online Account Password**: A complex password (8-20 characters with letters, numbers, and special characters) used to access your account through our website and mobile app.

**My Account App PIN**: A 4-6 digit number that provides quick access to your mobile app after initial login with your password.

## Changing Your Account PIN

1. **Online**: Log into your account at [my.telecom.com](https://my.telecom.com) or through the My Account app, navigate to "Account Settings" > "Security" > "Change PIN"
2. **Phone**: Call customer service at 1-800-XXX-XXXX and verify your identity through our authentication process
3. **In-store**: Visit any retail location with a government-issued photo ID

PIN changes take effect immediately. For security purposes, PINs cannot be recoveredâ€”only reset.

## Changing Your Online Password

1. Log into your account (or use the "Forgot Password" option if locked out)
2. Navigate to "Account Settings" > "Security" > "Change Password"
3. Enter your current password and create a new one following our security requirements
4. Password changes take effect immediately across all platforms (website and mobile app)

## Verification Requirements

For all security credential changes, you must verify your identity through one or more methods:
- Current PIN/password
- Answers to security questions
- One-time verification code sent to your registered email or phone
- Government-issued photo ID (in-store only)

## Important Considerations

- **Billing Impact**: Changing your PIN or password does not affect your billing cycle or payment methods
- **Service Impact**: A forgotten PIN may temporarily delay account changes requiring verification
- **Recovery Time**: PIN resets may take up to 24 hours to process if extensive identity verification is needed
- **Automatic Lockouts**: After 5 incorrect password attempts, your online account will be temporarily locked for 30 minutes
- **Multi-device Sync**: Password changes will require re-authentication on all devices where you're logged in

## Additional Security Recommendations

- Update your PIN and passwords every 3-6 months
- Don't use easily guessed information (birthdays, addresses, sequential numbers)
- Enable two-factor authentication for additional security
- iOS users can enable Touch ID/Face ID in the My Account app settings
- Android users can enable fingerprint authentication in the My Account app settings

For additional assistance with account security, contact customer support at 1-800-XXX-XXXX.
