# Why is my mobile data not working?

Mobile data connectivity issues can be frustrating, but many common problems can be resolved with simple troubleshooting steps. Follow this guide to diagnose and potentially fix your mobile data connection.

## Basic Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Check if mobile data is enabled**
   * **iOS**: Go to Settings > Cellular and ensure "Cellular Data" is toggled on
   * **Android**: Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile network and ensure "Mobile data" is toggled on

2. **Verify you're not in Airplane Mode**
   * **iOS**: Open Control Center (swipe down from top-right corner) and check if Airplane Mode icon is highlighted
   * **Android**: Swipe down from the top of your screen to access Quick Settings and check if Airplane Mode is active

3. **Check your signal strength**
   * Look at the signal bars in the status bar of your device
   * If you have one bar or no bars, try moving to a different location

4. **Restart your device**
   * **iOS**: Press and hold the side button and either volume button until the slider appears, then drag to power off. Wait 30 seconds before turning it back on
   * **Android**: Press and hold the power button until the power menu appears, then tap "Restart"

## Advanced Troubleshooting

5. **Reset network settings**
   * **iOS**: Go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings
   * **Android**: Go to Settings > System > Reset options > Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth

6. **Check APN settings**
   * **iOS**: Go to Settings > Cellular > Cellular Data Network
   * **Android**: Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile network > Advanced > Access Point Names
   * Verify the APN settings match those provided by your carrier (available in our mobile app under Account > Network Settings)

7. **Update your device software**
   * **iOS**: Go to Settings > General > Software Update
   * **Android**: Go to Settings > System > System update

8. **Check data usage limits**
   * **iOS**: Go to Settings > Cellular > Cellular Data
   * **Android**: Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile network > Data warning & limit
   * You can also check your remaining data in our mobile app under Usage > Data

## Common Error Messages

* **"Mobile data network unavailable"**: Try toggling Airplane Mode on and off

## Device-Specific Issues

### iPhone Users
