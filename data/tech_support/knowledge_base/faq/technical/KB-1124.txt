# How Do I Set Up International Roaming on My Device?

International roaming allows you to use your mobile service while traveling abroad. This guide will help you properly configure your device for international travel to avoid unexpected charges and ensure connectivity.

## Before You Travel

1. **Check your plan compatibility**
   * Log into your account through our mobile app or website
   * Navigate to "Plan Details" > "International Services"
   * Verify if international roaming is included or needs to be added

2. **Activate international roaming**
   * If not already included, add international roaming through:
     * Mobile app: "Services" > "Add Features" > "International"
     * Online account: "Manage Plan" > "Add-ons" > "International Services"
     * Customer Support: Call 1-800-XXX-XXXX
   * Activation typically processes within 2 hours but may take up to 24 hours

3. **Consider a travel pass or international data package**
   * Daily travel passes often provide better value than pay-as-you-go rates
   * Data-only packages are available for tablet/hotspot devices

## Device Setup Instructions

1. **Enable data roaming**
   * Go to Settings > Connections/Network & Internet > Mobile Network

   * Select "Choose Automatically"

3. **Configure APN settings if needed**
   * Go to Settings > Connections/Network & Internet > Mobile Network > Access Point Names
   * Ensure the default APN is selected
   * If connectivity issues persist, contact support for country-specific APN settings

### iOS Devices (iPhone/iPad)

1. **Enable data roaming**
   * Go to Settings > Cellular/Mobile Data
   * Tap "Cellular/Mobile Data Options"
   * Toggle "Data Roaming" to ON

2. **Set network selection to automatic**
   * Go to Settings > Carrier/Mobile Data

   * Wait for available networks to appear
   * Turn "Automatic" back ON

3. **Reset network settings if experiencing issues**
   * Go to Settings > General > Reset

   * Note: This will remove saved WiFi passwords

## Common Error Messages and Solutions
