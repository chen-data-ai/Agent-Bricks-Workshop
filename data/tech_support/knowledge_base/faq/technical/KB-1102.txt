# Why Is My Phone Not Receiving Calls?

## Overview
If your phone isn't receiving incoming calls, this can be frustrating and concerning. Callers might hear ringing while your phone shows no incoming call, or calls may go straight to voicemail. This guide will help you troubleshoot the issue step-by-step.

## Common Symptoms
- Callers report your phone rings but you don't receive calls
- Incoming calls go straight to voicemail
- You see missed call notifications without the phone ever ringing
- Error message: "Call Failed" or "Connection Problem"

## Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Check Network Signal
**For all devices:**
- Verify you have adequate signal strength (at least 2-3 bars)
- Check if the signal icon shows "No Service" or "Emergency Calls Only"
- Try moving to a different location to see if reception improves

**Common error:** Signal bars present but showing "Emergency Calls Only" indicates a network registration issue.
