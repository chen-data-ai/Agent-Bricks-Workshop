# Bluetooth Connectivity Problems

## Why can't my device connect to Bluetooth accessories?

Bluetooth connectivity issues can be frustrating when trying to use wireless headphones, speakers, car systems, or other accessories. Follow these troubleshooting steps to resolve common Bluetooth problems.

### Basic Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Ensure Bluetooth is turned on**
   * **iOS**: Swipe down from the top-right corner (iPhone X or later) or up from the bottom (iPhone 8 or earlier) to access Control Center and tap the Bluetooth icon to turn it on
   * **Android**: Swipe down from the top of the screen to access Quick Settings and tap the Bluetooth icon to enable it

2. **Check if the accessory is powered on and in pairing mode**
   * Most Bluetooth devices have a specific button or button combination to enter pairing mode
   * Look for flashing lights (usually blue or alternating red/blue) indicating pairing mode
   * Refer to your accessory's manual for specific pairing instructions

3. **Restart both devices**
   * Turn off your phone and Bluetooth device completely
   * Turn them back on after 10 seconds
   * Try connecting again

4. **Forget and re-pair the device**
   * **iOS**: Go to Settings > Bluetooth > tap the (i) icon next to the device > "Forget This Device" > confirm
   * **Android**: Go to Settings > Connected devices > Previously connected devices > tap the gear icon next to the device > "Forget" or "Unpair"
   * Put your accessory in pairing mode again and reconnect

### Common Error Messages and Solutions
