# FAQ: Why is my mobile signal strength poor or inconsistent?

## Understanding Signal Issues

Poor signal strength can cause dropped calls, slow data speeds, and messaging delays. This guide will help you troubleshoot and potentially resolve signal problems before contacting customer support.

## Common Symptoms
* One bar or no bars displayed in your status bar
* Calls dropping or poor call quality
* Slow data speeds or inability to connect to mobile data
* "No Service" or "Emergency Calls Only" message
* "SOS Only" (iOS) or "Emergency Calls Only" (Android)

## Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Check Network Coverage
* Verify you're in a coverage area using our coverage map in the MyAccount app or at [company website]/coverage
* Signal strength naturally varies by location (buildings, rural areas, underground)
* If you recently moved, check if your new location has adequate coverage

### 2. Restart Your Device
* **Android**: Press and hold the power button, then tap "Restart"
* **iOS**: Press and hold the side button and either volume button until the slider appears, slide to power off, then press and hold the side button to restart

### 3. Toggle Airplane Mode
* **Android**: Swipe down from the top of your screen and tap the airplane icon, wait 30 seconds, then tap again
* **iOS**: Go to Settings or Control Center (swipe down from top-right), enable Airplane Mode, wait 30 seconds, then disable it

### 4. Check for Network Settings Updates
* **Android**: Go to Settings > System > Advanced > System update, or Settings > About phone > System updates
* **iOS**: Go to Settings > General > Software Update

### 5. Reset Network Settings
**Note**: This will remove saved Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth pairings
* **Android**: Go to Settings > System > Reset options > Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth
* **iOS**: Go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings

### 6. Check SIM Card
* Power off your device
* Remove and reinsert your SIM card to ensure proper connection
* Check for physical damage to the SIM card
* If damaged, contact support for a replacement SIM

### 7. Manual Network Selection
* **Android**: Go to Settings > Connections/Network & Internet > Mobile network > Network operators > Search networks
* **iOS**: Go to Settings > Cellular > Network Selection, toggle off Automatic and select your carrier

### 8. Signal Boosting Solutions
* Consider a signal booster or femtocell if you consistently have poor coverage at home
* Wi-Fi Calling can be enabled in:
  * **Android**: Settings > Connections > Wi-Fi Calling
  * **iOS**: Settings > Cellular > Wi-Fi Calling
