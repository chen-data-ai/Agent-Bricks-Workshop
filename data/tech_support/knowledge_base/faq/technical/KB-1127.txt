# Why is my device not receiving software updates?

Software updates provide important security patches, bug fixes, and new features for your device. If you're experiencing issues with updates, follow these troubleshooting steps to resolve common problems.

## Common Symptoms
- Update notifications not appearing
- Updates failing to download
- Installation errors
- Updates getting stuck at a certain percentage
- "Update not available" messages despite knowing a new version exists

## Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Check Your Connection
- Ensure you're connected to a stable Wi-Fi network
- Updates typically require Wi-Fi and won't download over cellular data
- Try connecting to a different Wi-Fi network if available

### 2. Check Storage Space
**For Android:**
- Go to Settings > Storage
- If less than 1GB is available, delete unnecessary files or apps
- Clear cache: Settings > Apps > [Select apps] > Storage > Clear Cache

**For iOS:**
- Go to Settings > General > iPhone Storage
- If less than 1GB is available, remove unused apps or media
- Offload unused apps: Settings > General > iPhone Storage > Offload Unused Apps

### 3. Verify Device Compatibility

**For Android:**
- Go to Settings > About phone > Software information
- Check if your current Android version is still supported
- Devices older than 3-4 years may no longer receive updates

**For iOS:**
- Go to Settings > General > About
- Check your iOS version
- Visit apple.com/ios/ios-16 (or current version) to verify compatibility

### 4. Force Check for Updates

**For Android:**
- Go to Settings > System > System update > Check for update
- Alternatively, open the Settings app and search for "update"

**For iOS:**
- Go to Settings > General > Software Update
- If "Automatic Updates" is enabled, toggle it off and on again

### 5. Reset Network Settings

**For Android:**
- Go to Settings > System > Reset options > Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth
- Note: This will remove all saved networks and paired devices

**For iOS:**
- Go to Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Reset > Reset Network Settings
- Note: This will remove all saved Wi-Fi passwords
