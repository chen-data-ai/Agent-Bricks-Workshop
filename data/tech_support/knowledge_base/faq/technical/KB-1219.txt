# How do I enable and troubleshoot VoLTE on my device?

## What is VoLTE?
Voice over LTE (VoLTE) allows you to make high-quality voice calls over our 4G LTE network instead of using the traditional voice network. Benefits include clearer calls, faster call connection, and the ability to use data while on a call.

## Device Compatibility
Before troubleshooting, confirm your device supports VoLTE. Most smartphones manufactured after 2016 are VoLTE-capable, but carrier compatibility varies.

## Enabling VoLTE

### On Android devices:
1. Open the **Settings** app
2. Tap on **Network & Internet** (or **Connections** on Samsung devices)
3. Select **Mobile network**
4. Look for **VoLTE**, **HD calling**, or **Advanced Calling** and toggle it on
5. Restart your device for changes to take effect

### On iOS devices (iPhone):
1. Go to **Settings**
2. Tap **Cellular**
3. Select **Cellular Data Options**
4. Tap **Voice & Data**
5. Enable **VoLTE**
6. Restart your device

## Common Troubleshooting Steps

If VoLTE isn't working properly after enabling:

1. **Check network coverage**: VoLTE requires strong 4G LTE signal
2. **Update device software**: Ensure your device has the latest operating system
3. **Update carrier settings**:
   - iOS: Go to Settings > General > About (wait for carrier settings update prompt)
   - Android: Check for carrier updates in Settings > System > Advanced > System update
4. **Reset network settings**:
   - iOS: Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings
   - Android: Settings > System > Reset options > Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth
5. **Check SIM card**: Ensure your SIM is properly seated and not damaged

## Common Error Messages

| Error Message | Possible Solution |
|--------------|-------------------|
| "VoLTE not available in your area" | Move to an area with better LTE coverage or contact support to verify service availability |
| "VoLTE not supported on this device" | Your device may not be compatible or may need a software update |
| "Unable to enable VoLTE" | Restart your device, reset network settings, or contact support |

## Device-Specific Instructions

### Samsung Galaxy devices:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Connections** > **Mobile networks**
2. Toggle on **VoLTE calls** or **HD Voice**
3. If not visible, try dialing `*#*#4636#*#*` to access testing menu, then select **Phone information** and enable VoLTE
