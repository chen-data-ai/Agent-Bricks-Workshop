# Why is my phone not receiving calls?

## Common symptoms
- Incoming calls go straight to voicemail
- Callers hear "The person you are calling is unavailable"
- Missed call notifications appear without the phone ringing
- No incoming call screen displays for incoming calls

## Basic troubleshooting steps

### 1. Check your network connection
- Verify you have adequate signal strength (at least 2-3 bars)
- Check if the mobile data or Wi-Fi icon appears in your status bar
- Try toggling Airplane Mode on for 30 seconds, then off again
- If using Wi-Fi Calling, ensure your Wi-Fi connection is stable

### 2. Verify call settings
**For Android devices:**
- Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile network > Advanced > Call settings
- Ensure Call Forwarding is disabled or not forwarding to another number
- Check that Call Barring is not enabled
- Verify Do Not Disturb mode is turned off (check Quick Settings panel)

**For iPhone:**
- Go to Settings > Phone > Call Forwarding and ensure it's turned off
- Check Settings > Focus to ensure Do Not Disturb is disabled
- Verify that Silence Unknown Callers is off (Settings > Phone)

### 3. Restart your device
- Android: Press and hold the power button, then tap "Restart"
- iPhone: Press and hold side button and volume button until the slider appears, slide to power off, then press and hold the side button to restart

### 4. Check for blocked numbers
**For Android devices:**
- Open the Phone app > More (three dots) > Settings > Blocked numbers
- Remove any numbers that shouldn't be blocked

**For iPhone:**
- Go to Settings > Phone > Blocked Contacts
- Review the list and unblock any contacts as needed

### 5. Update your carrier settings and software
**For Android devices:**
- Go to Settings > System > System update
- Check for carrier settings updates in Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile network > Advanced > Carrier settings

**For iPhone:**
- Go to Settings > General > Software Update
- If a carrier settings update is available, you'll be prompted to update

### 6. Check your SIM card
