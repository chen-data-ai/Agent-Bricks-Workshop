# How Can I Remove My Device from a Blacklist?

## What is a device blacklist?

A device blacklist (sometimes called the IMEI database) is a shared registry that wireless carriers use to track lost, stolen, or fraudulently obtained devices. When a device is blacklisted, it cannot be activated on most carrier networks in the country.

## Why might my device be blacklisted?

Your device may be blacklisted if:
- It was reported lost or stolen
- It has unpaid financial obligations on a previous account
- It was purchased from an unauthorized retailer
- There was fraud associated with the device

## How to check if your device is blacklisted

### For all devices:
1. Locate your device's IMEI number by:
   - Dialing *#06# on your phone
   - Checking under Settings > About Phone/About Device > IMEI (Android)
   - Checking under Settings > General > About > IMEI (iOS)
   - Looking on the original packaging or receipt
2. Visit our online IMEI checker tool at [carrier website]/imei-check
3. Enter your IMEI number and submit

### Common error messages:
- "Device blacklisted due to loss/theft report"
- "Device has financial obligations"
- "Device cannot be activated on our network"

## Steps to remove your device from the blacklist

### If you are the original owner:

1. **For devices reported lost/stolen:**
   - Log into your account through our mobile app or website
   - Navigate to "Device Management" section
   - Select the device in question
   - Choose "Report Device Found"
   - Follow the verification prompts
   - Allow 24-48 hours for processing

2. **For devices with financial obligations:**
   - Log into your account
   - Check for any outstanding balance
   - Pay the remaining balance
   - Request blacklist removal through the app's "Support" section
   - Note: Removal typically processes within 24-72 hours after payment clears

### If you purchased the device from someone else:

1. Contact the original owner and ask them to:
   - Remove the lost/stolen report with their carrier
   - Settle any outstanding payments on the device
   - Provide you with proof of purchase and ownership transfer

2. If unable to contact the original owner:
   - Gather all proof of your legitimate purchase (receipt, payment record)
   - Contact our support team with this documentation
   - Be prepared to provide the IMEI number and your identification

## Device-specific verification processes

### Android devices:
- Samsung: Additional verification may be required through Samsung's Find My Mobile service
- Google Pixel: Google account verification may be needed
- Other Android: Manufacturer-specific verification may apply

### iOS devices:
- Ensure Activation Lock/Find My iPhone is disabled
- The previous owner must remove the device from their Apple ID
- Apple devices require both carrier blacklist removal AND Apple Activation Lock removal

## When to contact support

Contact our support team immediately if:
- You've followed all steps but the device remains blacklisted after 72 hours
- You receive error message "Blacklist removal denied"
- You have proof of legitimate purchase but cannot reach the original owner
- The blacklist originated from a different carrier
- You believe your device was blacklisted in error

Our support team can be reached at:
- Through the mobile app: Support > Device Issues > Blacklist Inquiry
- Phone: [carrier support number]
- Online chat: [carrier website]/support
- In-store: Visit any of our retail locations with your device and proof of purchase

**Note:** Providing false information during the blacklist removal process is against our terms of service and may result in permanent blacklisting of the device.
