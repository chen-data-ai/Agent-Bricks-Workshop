Before troubleshooting your device, verify you're in a 5G coverage area:

- **iOS**: Press and hold the side button and either volume button until the slider appears, then drag to power off. After the device turns off, press and hold the side button to restart

### Step 3: Check Mobile Data Settings

4. Restart your device

**For iOS devices:**
