# FAQ: Why is my cellular data not working?

## Overview
If you're experiencing issues with your cellular data connection, several factors could be causing the problem. This guide will help you troubleshoot common issues and restore your data connection.

## Common Symptoms
- "No Data Connection" or "No Internet" message

- "E" or "2G" icon instead of "4G", "LTE", or "5G" in status bar

**For iOS:**
- Swipe down from the top-right corner (iPhone X or later) or up from the bottom (iPhone 8 or earlier) to open Control Center
- Ensure Airplane Mode icon (airplane symbol) is not highlighted
- Or go to Settings and verify Airplane Mode is OFF

### 2. Verify Data is enabled
**For Android:**
- Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile Network
- Ensure Mobile Data is toggled ON

### 7. Check APN settings
