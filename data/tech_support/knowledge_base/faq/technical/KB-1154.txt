# How to Set Up and Troubleshoot Your Mobile Hotspot

## What is a mobile hotspot?
A mobile hotspot allows you to share your smartphone's cellular data connection with other devices like laptops, tablets, or other smartphones via Wi-Fi.

## How to set up your mobile hotspot

### On Android devices:
1. Open the **Settings** app
2. Tap **Network & Internet** (or **Connections** on Samsung devices)
3. Tap **Hotspot & tethering** or **Mobile Hotspot and Tethering**
4. Tap **Mobile Hotspot** or **Wi-Fi hotspot**
5. Toggle the switch to **ON**
6. Optional: Tap **Configure** or **Hotspot settings** to:
   - Change the network name (SSID)
   - Set or change your password
   - Select security type (WPA2 is recommended)
   - Choose the frequency band (5GHz offers faster speeds but shorter range)

### On iOS devices (iPhone/iPad):
1. Open the **Settings** app
2. Tap **Personal Hotspot**
3. Toggle **Allow Others to Join** to **ON**
4. Note the Wi-Fi password displayed (or tap it to create your own)
5. Optional: Connect via Bluetooth or USB if preferred

## Common troubleshooting steps

### Hotspot not appearing on other devices
1. Verify hotspot is enabled (check for confirmation icon in status bar)
2. Ensure you're within 30 feet of the hotspot device
3. Restart the hotspot feature by turning it off and on again
4. Restart your phone completely
5. Check if Airplane Mode is accidentally enabled (it should be OFF)

### Connection drops frequently
1. Check your cellular signal strength (at least 2-3 bars recommended)
2. Move to a location with better reception
3. Reduce the number of connected devices (most plans limit to 5-10 devices)
4. Update your device's operating system
5. If using 5GHz, try switching to 2.4GHz for better range

### Slow hotspot speeds
1. Verify you have sufficient data plan coverage for hotspot usage
2. Check if you've reached your high-speed data cap
3. Test your cellular network speed using a speed test app
4. Close background apps on your hotspot device
5. Connect fewer devices simultaneously

## Common error messages and solutions

### "Hotspot could not be activated" (Android)
- Restart your device
- Check for system updates
- Reset network settings: Settings > System > Reset options > Reset network settings

### "Unable to start Personal Hotspot" (iOS)
- Make sure cellular data is turned on
- Check for carrier settings updates: Settings > General > About
- Reset network settings: Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings

### "Mobile Hotspot has been disabled due to inactivity" 
- This is normal behavior to save battery. Simply re-enable the hotspot.

### "Data limit reached" or "Data usage warning"
