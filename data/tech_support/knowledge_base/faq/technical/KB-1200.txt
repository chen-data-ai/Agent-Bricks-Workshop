# FAQ: Why is my eSIM not activating properly?

## Common Symptoms
- "eSIM profile download failed" message
- Unable to connect to mobile network after eSIM installation
- "Invalid QR code" or "Expired activation code" errors
- Device shows "No service" with eSIM selected
- Cellular data not working despite successful eSIM installation

## Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Verify Basic Requirements
- Ensure your device is eSIM compatible (most flagship phones from 2018 onward)
- Confirm your device is connected to a stable Wi-Fi network
- Check that your account is in good standing with no payment issues
- Verify the eSIM activation code or QR code hasn't expired (typically valid for 14 days)

### Step 2: Restart Your Device
A simple restart can resolve many activation issues:
1. Power off your device completely
2. Wait 30 seconds
3. Power it back on
4. Try the eSIM activation process again

### Step 3: Device-Specific Solutions

**For iPhone (iOS 13 or later):**
1. Go to Settings > General > About and check for a carrier settings update
2. If prompted, tap "Update" and wait for completion
3. Go to Settings > Cellular > Add Cellular Plan
4. Try scanning your QR code again or manually enter the activation details
5. If you receive "Cellular Plan Cannot Be Added" error, go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings (note: this will remove saved Wi-Fi passwords)

**For Android (version 10 or later):**
1. Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile Network > + Add > Download a SIM instead?
2. Scan the QR code or enter details manually
3. If you receive "Couldn't download your eSIM" error, clear cache for the "SIM Manager" app:
   - Go to Settings > Apps > SIM Manager > Storage > Clear Cache
4. Try activation again

### Step 4: Check for Common Error Messages

**"Profile Download Failed"**
- Ensure airplane mode is OFF during activation
- Try using a different Wi-Fi network
- Check if your device has the latest software update

**"QR Code Invalid or Expired"**
- Request a new eSIM activation code through our mobile app or online account
- Ensure you're scanning the correct QR code (not a previous or expired one)

**"Network Not Available"**
- Check if your device is in a coverage area
- Toggle airplane mode on and off
- Remove and re-add the eSIM profile
