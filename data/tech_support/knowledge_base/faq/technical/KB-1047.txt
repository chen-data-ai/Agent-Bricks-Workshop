# Why is my network coverage poor or unavailable?

## Understanding the Issue

Poor network coverage can manifest as dropped calls, slow data speeds, delayed text messages, or complete service unavailability. This can be caused by various factors including your location, device settings, network congestion, or temporary outages.

## Common Error Messages You May See

**First, verify if there's a known outage in your area:**
