# How Do I Set Up and Troubleshoot Wi-Fi Calling?

## What is Wi-Fi Calling?
Wi-Fi Calling allows you to make and receive calls and text messages over a Wi-Fi network when cellular coverage is limited or unavailable. This service is included in your plan at no additional cost and uses your regular phone number.

## Setting Up Wi-Fi Calling

### For iPhone (iOS):
1. Ensure your iPhone is running iOS 8.0 or later
2. Go to **Settings** > **Phone** > **Wi-Fi Calling**
3. Toggle on **Wi-Fi Calling on This iPhone**
4. You may be prompted to enter or verify your emergency address
5. When successfully activated, you'll see "Wi-Fi" next to your carrier name in the status bar

### For Android:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Network & Internet** > **Calls & SMS** (or **Mobile network** depending on your device)
2. Tap **Wi-Fi Calling**
3. Toggle the switch to **On**
4. Enter your emergency address when prompted
5. When active, you'll see a Wi-Fi calling indicator in your status bar

## Common Error Messages and Solutions

### "Wi-Fi Calling Activation Failed"
* Restart your device and try again
* Ensure you have the latest software update installed
* Check that your account is eligible for Wi-Fi Calling (contact support if unsure)

### "Emergency Address Required"

## Troubleshooting Steps

   * Not all devices support Wi-Fi Calling. Check our mobile app or website for a list of compatible devices

2. **Check your Wi-Fi connection**
   * Ensure you're connected to a stable Wi-Fi network
   * Wi-Fi Calling works best with download speeds of at least 2 Mbps

3. **Update your device**

   * For iPhones: Settings > General > Software Update
   * For Android: Settings > System > System update (may vary by manufacturer)

4. **Reset network settings**

   * For Android: Settings > System > Reset options > Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth

5. **Check account status**
