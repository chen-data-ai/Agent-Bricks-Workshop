# What are device protection plans and how do they work?

## Overview
Device protection plans are optional insurance services that safeguard your mobile device against damage, loss, theft, and mechanical/electrical failures after the manufacturer's warranty expires. These plans provide peace of mind by covering repair or replacement costs that would otherwise be expensive out-of-pocket expenses.

## Coverage Details
Our device protection plans typically cover:
* Accidental damage (drops, spills, cracked screens)
* Loss and theft
* Mechanical and electrical failures after manufacturer's warranty
* Battery replacement (when battery capacity falls below 80%)
* Same-day device replacement at local stores (subject to inventory availability)
* Next-day shipping for replacement devices

## Plan Options and Compatibility

### Basic Protection ($8-12/month)
* Compatible with all standard smartphones and basic phones
* Covers mechanical/electrical failures
* $99-149 deductible for replacements
* Up to 2 claims per 12-month period

### Premium Protection ($12-15/month)
* Compatible with all smartphones and tablets
* Covers everything in Basic plus accidental damage
* $49-99 deductible for repairs, $149-199 for replacements
* Up to 3 claims per 12-month period

### Premium+ Protection ($15-18/month)

3. Follow the prompts to describe the issue and verify your device details
4. Pay any applicable deductible
5. Choose your replacement method (in-store pickup or delivery)

## Maximizing Value

### Practical Example 1: Screen Damage
Sarah dropped her new smartphone and cracked the screen. Without protection, screen replacement would cost $279. With Premium Protection, she paid just $49 for the repair, saving $230.

### Practical Example 2: Lost Device
Michael lost his phone while traveling. With Premium+ Protection, he received a replacement device the next day for a $199 deductible instead of paying $899 for a new phone. He also recovered his photos and contacts through the included cloud backup.

### Practical Example 3: Battery Degradation
After 18 months, David's phone battery only lasted half a day. His Basic Protection plan covered a free battery replacement, extending his device's usable life by years.

## Additional Information
