# How Does Spam Call Filtering Work on Our Network?

## Overview
Our Spam Call Filtering service helps protect you from unwanted calls by identifying and blocking potential spam calls before they reach your device. The service uses advanced algorithms to analyze calling patterns and known spam numbers to provide real-time protection against robocalls, telemarketers, and potential scammers.

## How It Works
When a call comes through our network, our system:
1. Checks the incoming number against our constantly updated database of known spam callers
2. Analyzes calling patterns and behaviors typical of spam operations
3. Assigns a risk level to the call (Low, Medium, or High)
4. Takes action based on your selected protection level

Depending on your settings, suspicious calls will either:
- Display with a "Potential Spam" warning on your screen
- Be sent directly to voicemail
- Be blocked entirely from reaching your device
