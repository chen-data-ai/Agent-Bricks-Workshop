## Maximizing Your Rewards

**Example Strategies:**
1. **New Customer:** Enroll in paperless billing (+25 points), download our app (+10 points), and refer two friends (+1,000 points) to earn enough for a $10 bill credit in your first month.

2. **Family Plan:** With 4 lines averaging $160/month, you'll earn approximately 160 points monthly from spending alone. Add on-time payment bonuses (+50 points) to earn over 2,500 points annuallyâ€”enough for three months of premium features.

3. **Long-term Customer:** Combine your anniversary bonus (100 points) with regular monthly spending points and on-time payment bonuses to earn approximately 3,000 points annually, which could be used for device upgrade credits.
