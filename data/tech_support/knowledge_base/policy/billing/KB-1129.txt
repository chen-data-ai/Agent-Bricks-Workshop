# Service Interruption Credits Policy

## Overview
This policy outlines the terms, conditions, and procedures for service interruption credits. When our network experiences outages or service degradation, eligible customers may receive bill credits as compensation for the affected service period.

## Definitions
- **Service Interruption**: A complete loss of service or significant degradation that renders the service unusable for its intended purpose
- **Planned Maintenance**: Scheduled network updates announced at least 48 hours in advance
- **Force Majeure Event**: Circumstances beyond our reasonable control including natural disasters, acts of terrorism, or government actions

## Eligibility Criteria
Customers may qualify for service interruption credits when:
1. The interruption lasts longer than 4 consecutive hours
2. The issue is within our network and not caused by customer equipment or third-party services
3. The customer reports the outage within 7 days of occurrence
4. The customer's account is in good standing (not past due)

## Credit Calculation
Credits are calculated as follows:
- For residential services: 1/30th of the monthly recurring charge for each 24-hour period of interruption
- For business services: 1/720th of the monthly recurring charge for each hour of interruption
- Minimum credit amount: $1.00

## Exclusions
Credits will not be issued for:
- Planned maintenance performed during designated maintenance windows (typically 12:00 AM - 6:00 AM local time)
- Service interruptions caused by customer equipment or actions
- Force majeure events
- Customers with past-due balances until accounts are brought current

1. Contact Customer Support via the mobile app, online account portal, or by calling 1-800-XXX-XXXX within 7 days of the interruption
2. Provide the date, time, and duration of the service interruption
3. Describe the nature of the interruption (complete outage, intermittent service, etc.)

## Processing and Application

## Customer Rights
Customers retain the right to:
