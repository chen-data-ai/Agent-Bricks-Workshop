# Family Plan Billing Policy

## Overview
This policy document outlines the billing procedures, customer rights, and company obligations regarding Family Plans. Family Plans allow multiple lines to share a single account with consolidated billing while providing individual usage allocations.

## Definitions
- **Account Holder**: The primary customer responsible for payment of all lines on the Family Plan
- **Additional Line**: Any line beyond the primary line added to the Family Plan
- **Billing Cycle**: The recurring monthly period for which service charges are applied
- **Prorated Charges**: Partial charges calculated based on the number of days of service within a billing cycle

## Billing Structure
Family Plans consist of:
1. A base plan fee for the primary line
2. A reduced monthly access fee for each additional line
3. Shared or individual data allocations as specified in the selected plan
4. Any additional features, services, or device payments per line
