# Prorated Billing Policy

## Overview
This policy document outlines our approach to prorated billing, which occurs when service charges are calculated based on the actual number of days service was provided within a billing cycle. Prorated charges ensure customers only pay for the services they receive.

## Definitions
**Prorated Billing**: The calculation of charges based on the portion of a billing cycle during which service is active.

**Billing Cycle**: The recurring period (typically monthly) for which service charges are assessed.

**Activation Date**: The date on which a service is initiated or a change becomes effective.

**Termination Date**: The date on which a service is discontinued.

## When Prorated Billing Applies
Prorated charges will appear on your bill in the following situations:

1. **New Service Activation**: When service begins on any day other than the first day of your billing cycle.
2. **Service Termination**: When service ends before the conclusion of your billing cycle.
3. **Plan Changes**: When you upgrade or downgrade your service plan mid-cycle.
4. **Feature Addition/Removal**: When features with recurring charges are added or removed mid-cycle.

## Calculation Method
Prorated charges are calculated using the following formula:

(Monthly charge ÷ Total days in billing cycle) × Number of applicable days

For example, if your monthly plan costs $60, your billing cycle is 30 days, and you activate service on the 15th day:
- Prorated charge = ($60 ÷ 30) × 16 = $32

## Billing Cycle Information
1. Your billing cycle begins on the same date each month.
2. The first bill after activation or service change will include:
   - Any applicable one-time fees
   - Prorated charges for the partial first billing cycle
   - Full charges for the upcoming billing cycle
