# Refund Policy

## Overview
This document outlines our company's refund policy for all telecommunications services and products. It establishes the conditions under which customers may receive refunds, the applicable timeframes, and the procedures for requesting and processing refunds.

## Definitions
- **Billing Cycle**: The recurring period (typically monthly) for which service charges are applied
- **Prorated Refund**: A partial refund calculated based on the unused portion of a service
- **Service Credit**: A credit applied to a customer's account for future services rather than a monetary refund
- **Chargeback**: A transaction reversal initiated by the customer's bank or credit card company

## Eligibility for Refunds

### Service Interruptions
Customers may be eligible for refunds when experiencing service outages or significant degradation of service under the following conditions:
- Outages lasting more than 24 consecutive hours
- Service performance consistently falling below 50% of advertised speeds for 72 hours or more
- Refunds are calculated as a prorated daily rate based on the monthly service fee

### Billing Errors
We will issue full refunds for:
