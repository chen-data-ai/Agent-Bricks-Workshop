# Refund Policy

## Overview
This document outlines our company's refund policy for telecommunications services, equipment purchases, and related charges. It explains customer eligibility for refunds, processing timeframes, and procedures for submitting refund requests.

## Definitions
- **Billing Cycle**: The period between billing statements, typically 30 days
- **Prorated Refund**: A partial refund calculated based on the unused portion of a service
- **Service Credit**: A credit applied to a customer's account for future services rather than returned as a monetary refund
- **Early Termination Fee (ETF)**: A charge for canceling service before the contract term ends

## Service Refund Eligibility

### Monthly Service Plans
- Customers may receive a prorated refund for unused service if cancellation occurs before the billing cycle ends
- Refunds will be calculated from the date of service cancellation request to the end of the billing cycle
- No refunds will be issued for partial-month usage if cancellation occurs after the 15th day of the billing cycle

### Prepaid Services
- Prepaid services are generally non-refundable once activated
- Unused prepaid cards or codes may be eligible for refund within 14 days of purchase if not activated, subject to a 15% processing fee

### Add-On Features
- One-time add-on features (e.g., international calling packages) are refundable if canceled within 24 hours of activation
- Monthly add-on features follow the same prorated refund policy as the main service plan

## Equipment Refund Policy

### New Devices
- New devices may be returned within 30 days of purchase with original packaging and all included accessories
- A restocking fee of 10% applies to opened devices returned after 14 days
- Devices showing signs of physical damage or excessive use are not eligible for refund

### Accessories
- Unopened accessories may be returned within 14 days for a full refund
- Opened accessories may be returned within 7 days, subject to a 20% restocking fee

## Refund Processing

### Timeframes
- Credit card refunds will be processed within 3-5 business days
- Bank account refunds may take 7-10 business days to appear
- Service credits will be applied to the customer's account within 1-2 billing cycles

### Method of Refund
- Refunds will be issued using the original payment method when possible
