# Telecom Refund Policy

## Overview
This policy outlines the terms and conditions under which customers may receive refunds for services, equipment, and charges from [Company Name]. Our goal is to ensure fair and transparent billing practices while providing clear procedures for resolving billing disputes.

## Definitions
- **Billing Cycle**: The recurring period (typically monthly) for which service charges are applied
- **Prorated Refund**: A partial refund calculated based on the unused portion of a service period
- **Service Credit**: An amount applied to a customer's account for future services rather than refunded directly
- **Disputed Charge**: Any charge formally contested by a customer through our dispute resolution process

## Eligibility for Refunds

### Service Charges
1. **Service Cancellation**: Customers who cancel services before the billing cycle ends are eligible for prorated refunds of unused service days.
2. **Service Outages**: Refunds may be issued for verified service outages exceeding 24 consecutive hours at a rate of 1/30th of the monthly charge per day of outage.
3. **Plan Changes**: When downgrading to a lower-cost plan, the difference will be prorated and applied as credit to the next bill.

### Equipment Returns
1. **New Devices**: Devices may be returned within 14 days of purchase for a full refund, provided they are in original condition with all accessories.
2. **Restocking Fee**: A $35 restocking fee applies to all returned devices unless they are defective.
3. **Defective Equipment**: Defective equipment reported within 30 days of receipt qualifies for free replacement or full refund without restocking fees.
