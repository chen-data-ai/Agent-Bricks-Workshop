# Signal Strength Policy and Resolution Procedures

## Overview
This document outlines our company's policies regarding signal strength issues, including our service standards, maintenance procedures, notification protocols, and resolution processes. It clarifies both customer and company responsibilities when addressing signal strength problems.

## Service Standards

### Signal Strength Commitments
- Our network is designed to provide minimum signal strength of -100 dBm outdoors and -110 dBm indoors in all advertised coverage areas
- Service availability target of 99.9% in primary coverage zones
- Voice call quality minimum Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 3.5/5
- Data throughput of at least 80% of advertised speeds when signal strength is adequate

### Coverage Limitations
- Natural terrain, building materials, and weather conditions may impact signal strength
- Coverage maps represent expected outdoor coverage and may differ from actual experience
- Indoor coverage may require additional solutions in some locations

## Maintenance Windows and Network Updates

### Scheduled Maintenance
- Routine maintenance: Monday-Thursday, 12:00 AM - 5:00 AM local time
- Quarterly system upgrades: First Sunday of each quarter, 12:00 AM - 6:00 AM local time

## Remediation Procedures

### Troubleshooting Process

2. Signal strength testing and analysis
3. Network equipment assessment
4. On-site investigation if necessary

### Resolution Options
- Network adjustments or repairs when infrastructure issues are identified
- Signal boosters or Wi-Fi calling solutions for eligible customers
- Temporary bill credits for extended service outages (24+ hours)
