# Data Throttling Policy

## Overview
This policy document outlines our approach to data throttling, which is the temporary reduction of data speeds after a customer reaches certain usage thresholds. This practice helps us manage network congestion, ensure fair access to all customers, and maintain overall service quality.

## Data Management Standards

### Throttling Thresholds
- Standard mobile plans: Data speeds may be reduced after 22GB of usage in a billing cycle
- Unlimited plans: Priority data allocation varies by plan tier (typically 50GB-100GB)
- Home internet services: Throttling may apply after 1TB of monthly data usage

### Reduced Speed Expectations
When throttling is applied, customers can expect:
- Standard throttled speeds of 2G-3G equivalent (128Kbps-512Kbps)
- Sufficient speeds for basic web browsing and messaging
- Potential limitations for streaming, gaming, and large file transfers

## Customer Notification Protocols

### Pre-Throttling Notifications
- SMS alerts at 75%, 90%, and 100% of high-speed data allocation
- Email notifications for account holders
- In-app notifications through our mobile application (iOS and Android)
- Usage tracking available through online account management portal

### During-Throttling Communication
- Banner notification in customer account portal indicating throttled status
- Throttling status visible in mobile app dashboard
- Option to receive SMS confirmation when throttling begins

## Service Maintenance Windows

### Scheduled Network Maintenance
- Network optimization occurs between 2:00 AM and 5:00 AM local time
- Maintenance schedules posted 7 days in advance on our website
- Critical maintenance notifications sent via SMS and email 48 hours in advance

### Throttling Implementation Timing
- Throttling typically activates within 1 hour of threshold being reached
- Throttling status resets at the beginning of each billing cycle
- System-wide throttling checks occur hourly

## Remediation Procedures

### Customer Options
- Purchase data add-ons through mobile app, website, or customer service
- Upgrade to higher-tier plans with increased high-speed data allocation
- One-time courtesy speed restoration available once per 12-month period (upon request)

### Dispute Resolution
- Customers may dispute throttling through customer service channels
- Usage disputes must be submitted within 30 days of throttling event
- Technical review will be completed within 48 business hours

## Customer Responsibilities

### Usage Monitoring
- Customers are responsible for monitoring their own data usage
- Tools provided: mobile app usage tracker, SMS alerts, online dashboard
- Setting personal usage alerts is recommended

### Network Etiquette
- Customers should avoid tethering devices in congested areas during peak hours
- Automatic app updates should be scheduled during off-peak hours
- Streaming quality settings should be adjusted based on network conditions

## Company Obligations

### Transparency
- All throttling policies clearly disclosed in Terms of Service
- Real-time network status updates available on company website
- Annual disclosure of network management practices

### Service Guarantees
- Throttled speeds will never fall below minimum advertised rates
- Essential services (emergency calling, text messaging) never throttled
- Financial credits available for verified cases of incorrect throttling

### Privacy Protection
- Usage data collected solely for network management purposes
- Individual usage patterns never shared with third parties
- Anonymized aggregate data used for network planning
