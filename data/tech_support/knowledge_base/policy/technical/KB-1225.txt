# Network Outage Policy

## Purpose
This policy outlines our procedures and commitments regarding network outages, including planned maintenance and unexpected service disruptions. It defines our service standards, notification protocols, and the respective responsibilities of our company and customers.

## Service Standards

### Uptime Commitment
- We strive to maintain 99.9% network availability, measured monthly
- This equates to a maximum of 43 minutes of unplanned downtime per month
- Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for business customers may specify different uptime guarantees

### Outage Classification
1. **Critical Outage**: Complete service loss affecting multiple service areas
2. **Major Outage**: Significant service degradation affecting a single service area
3. **Minor Outage**: Limited service impact affecting specific features or a small geographic area
4. **Planned Maintenance**: Scheduled network improvements with advance notification

## Maintenance Windows
