Re: Ticket TICK-8071 (Created: 2024-10-31 05:05)

I'm extremely frustrated with my latest bill which shows a $49.99 "Premium Content Access" charge that I NEVER authorized! I've been a loyal customer on your Ultimate Unlimited Family Plan for over 3 years and have never had this issue before. I checked my iPhone 15 Pro Max and there's absolutely no evidence of subscribing to any premium content. 

When I tried using the MyTelecom app to dispute the charge, I kept getting Error Code BIL-4023 "Unable to process billing inquiry at this time." I've already spent 45 minutes on hold trying to resolve this by phone yesterday evening.

This is completely unacceptable! I need this charge removed IMMEDIATELY as my autopay is scheduled to process tomorrow morning, and I refuse to pay for something I didn't order. I'm in the Portland area and have never had billing issues before, but this makes me seriously consider switching carriers after all these years.

Please contact me ASAP to resolve this before my payment processes. If this isn't fixed today, I'll be forced to file a complaint with the FCC.

# Resolution for Ticket TICK-8071 | Agent BIL-1635 | Resolved on 2024-11-03 05:05

Dear Valued Customer,

Thank you for bringing this billing concern to our attention. I sincerely apologize for the frustration you've experienced regarding the unauthorized $49.99 "Premium Content Access" charge on your account and the difficulty you encountered when attempting to resolve this through our MyTelecom app.

## Actions Taken:
1. Thoroughly reviewed your Ultimate Unlimited Family Plan account history and confirmed you have indeed been a loyal customer for over 3 years with no previous billing disputes.
2. Accessed our Content Subscription Management System (CSMS) and verified there was no authorization record for the Premium Content Access subscription on your line.
3. Investigated Error Code BIL-4023 in our system logs and identified a temporary technical issue with the billing dispute function in the MyTelecom app that has since been resolved.
4. Immediately processed a full credit of $49.99 to your account to remove the unauthorized charge.
5. Added a 12-month content subscription block to your account (per our Unauthorized Charge Protection Protocol) to prevent similar issues in the future.
6. Paused your scheduled autopay to ensure you wouldn't be charged while this issue was being resolved.

## Resolution Details:
The $49.99 charge has been fully credited to your account. Our investigation revealed this was due to a system error that incorrectly applied a third-party content subscription to your line. According to our Premium Content Billing Policy, customers must provide explicit authorization for such charges, which did not occur in this case.

I've also applied a one-time $20 account credit as a goodwill gesture for the inconvenience and time spent trying to resolve this issue, in accordance with our Customer Satisfaction Guarantee.

## Follow-up Actions:
1. Your autopay has been reactivated and will process normally for your next billing cycle.
2. I've sent detailed instructions to your registered email on how to monitor third-party charges through the MyTelecom app (Settings > Account > Subscriptions & Purchases).
3. Should you encounter any similar issues in the future, you can reach our dedicated Billing Support team directly at 1-800-XXX-XXXX (option 2).

We truly value your loyalty as a customer and understand how concerning unexpected charges can be. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any additional questions or concerns.

Thank you for your patience while we resolved this matter.

Sincerely,
Agent BIL-1635
Billing Resolution Team
