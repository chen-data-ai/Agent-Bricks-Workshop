Re: Ticket TICK-8015 (Created: 2024-08-21 04:44)

I'm beyond frustrated with my home internet service right now. For the third time this week, my connection keeps dropping every 15-20 minutes with the router showing a blinking red internet light. I have the UltraFiber 500 plan that I'm paying $89.99/month for, but I'm getting nowhere near the speeds I'm supposed to. When it actually works, speedtest.net shows only 78Mbps download and 23Mbps upload.

I've already tried power cycling the XTR-3000 router multiple times, checked all cable connections, and even tried connecting my laptop directly to the modem. Nothing helps! The error message on my router admin panel shows "ERR-4302: Connection Authentication Failed" whenever it drops.

I work from home and have an important video conference in 3 hours that I absolutely cannot miss. I've been a loyal customer for 5 years and this is unacceptable. My address is 1472 Westview Drive in Portland, and I need a technician to come out TODAY if possible. If this can't be fixed immediately, I'll need to be compensated for lost work time and will seriously consider switching to another provider.

My iPhone 15 Pro also shows "No Internet Connection" when connected to WiFi even though it shows full signal strength. Please help ASAP!
