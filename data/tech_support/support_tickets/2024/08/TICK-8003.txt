# Resolution for Ticket TICK-8003 | Agent TEC-8303 | Resolved on 2024-08-17 04:42

Dear Customer,

Thank you for your patience while we resolved your Motorola Edge eSIM activation issue. I understand how frustrating it can be when device setup doesn't go smoothly.

## Actions Taken:
1. Accessed our eSIM Provisioning System (EPS) to investigate error code E2735
2. Verified your account eligibility for eSIM service
3. Identified that error E2735 indicates an EID mismatch between our system and your device

## Resolution Process:
1. Reset your eSIM profile in our backend system
2. Manually verified and updated your device's EID in our Customer Information Management System (CIMS)
3. Generated a new eSIM QR code and activation token
4. Guided you through the proper eSIM installation process via the Motorola Edge settings menu:
   - Settings > Network & Internet > SIMs > Add eSIM > Scan QR code

The activation was successfully completed during our troubleshooting session, and we confirmed your device now shows proper network connectivity with full service.

## Additional Information:
As discussed, per our Service Guarantee Policy (SGP-2024), I've applied a service credit of $15.00 to your account for the inconvenience experienced during the activation process. This credit will appear on your next billing statement.

## Follow-up:
Please monitor your device connectivity over the next 24-48 hours. If you experience any further issues with your eSIM, please contact us immediately by:
- Using our Mobile Support App (available on both iOS and Android)
- Visiting your online account portal at our website
- Referencing this ticket number for expedited service

Is there anything else I can assist you with regarding your Motorola Edge or eSIM activation?

Best regards,
