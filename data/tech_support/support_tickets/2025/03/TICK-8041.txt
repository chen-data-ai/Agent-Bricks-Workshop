Re: Ticket TICK-8041 (Created: 2025-03-18 04:54)

I'm beyond frustrated with my internet connection right now. For the third time this week, my home WiFi keeps dropping every 15-20 minutes. I have your Premium Fiber 1Gig plan that I'm paying $89.99/month for, and this is unacceptable! I work from home as a software developer and have important video meetings. I just had to apologize to my entire team when I got kicked off our morning standup call.

My router is the GigaStream X7 model you provided when I upgraded last November. The status light keeps flashing amber instead of staying solid blue, and the app shows "Limited Connectivity - Error Code NTW-4503" when this happens. I've already tried rebooting the router multiple times, checked all cables, and even factory reset it following your online troubleshooting guide.

My iPhone 15 Pro and my wife's Galaxy S24 both show the same connection issues, so it's definitely not device-specific. Our smart home devices (Nest thermostats, Ring doorbell) keep going offline too.

I need this fixed IMMEDIATELY. I have a critical client presentation at 2PM today and cannot afford another disconnection. I'm at 1437 Oakridge Lane in Portland, and I need a technician today, not next week. If this isn't resolved quickly, I'll have no choice but to switch providers and request a refund for this month's service.

# Resolution for Ticket TICK-8041 | Agent TEC-2391 | Resolved on 2025-03-21 04:54

Dear Valued Customer,

I sincerely apologize for the significant internet connectivity issues you experienced with your Premium Fiber 1Gig service. I understand how disruptive these interruptions were to your work-from-home responsibilities, particularly during important meetings and presentations.

## Issue Diagnosis
After reviewing your account and the diagnostic logs from your GigaStream X7 router (Error Code NTW-4503), I identified two concurrent issues:

1. A firmware incompatibility between your router and our recent network infrastructure update
2. Signal degradation at the ONT (Optical Network Terminal) connection point

## Actions Taken
- Remotely accessed your GigaStream X7 router and performed advanced diagnostics
- Deployed emergency firmware update v3.8.7 to resolve compatibility issues
- Dispatched field technician (Service ID: FS-78542) to your residence on 2025-03-19
- Technician replaced the defective ONT and recalibrated the fiber optic connection
- Conducted comprehensive signal strength testing across all bands (2.4GHz/5GHz)
- Verified stable connectivity with all connected devices including your work equipment and smart home devices

## Service Adjustments
- Applied service credit of $45.00 (50% of your monthly Premium Fiber 1Gig plan) to your account for the service disruption
- Upgraded your account to our Network Priority status for 90 days at no additional cost, providing expedited technical support
- Added a note to your account ensuring priority scheduling for any future service needs

## Preventative Measures
- Enrolled your router in our Proactive Monitoring Program to detect potential issues before they impact your service
- Configured automatic firmware updates to occur during your preferred maintenance window (3:00 AM - 5:00 AM)
- Updated your Network Shield security settings to optimize performance for video conferencing applications

## Verification
I personally monitored your connection stability for 48 hours following these interventions and can confirm your service has maintained 100% uptime with optimal speed performance (consistently above 940Mbps download/880Mbps upload).

Per our Premium Service Guarantee (Policy ID: PSG-2025), we've also scheduled a courtesy follow-up call in 7 days to ensure your continued satisfaction.
