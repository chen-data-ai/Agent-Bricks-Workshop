# Resolution for Ticket TICK-8008 | Agent TEC-5560 | Resolved on 2025-02-26 04:43

Dear Customer,

Thank you for your patience while we resolved your iPhone 15 Pro eSIM activation issue with error code E8365. I understand how frustrating it can be when you're unable to complete your device setup, and I appreciate the opportunity to assist you.

## Actions Taken:
1. Accessed our eSIM Management System (EMS) to investigate the error code E8365, which indicates an incomplete carrier profile download
2. Verified your account eligibility for eSIM activation in our Customer Account Management System (CAMS)
3. Cleared the pending eSIM profile from your account using our backend provisioning tool
4. Generated a new eSIM QR code and activation token through our Secure Digital Profile Generator (SDPG)
5. Guided you through the proper eSIM installation process via iOS Settings > Cellular > Add Cellular Plan

## Root Cause:
The investigation revealed that your initial eSIM activation attempt was interrupted during the carrier profile download phase, likely due to network connectivity fluctuations. This left your account with a partially downloaded eSIM profile that prevented subsequent activation attempts.

## Resolution Details:
Following our troubleshooting session, we successfully:
- Removed the corrupted eSIM profile from your account
- Provisioned a new eSIM profile according to procedure TS-eSIM-2025-01
- Verified successful activation of your new eSIM profile
- Confirmed full network connectivity with successful test calls and data usage
- Applied a $15.00 service credit to your account (per our Activation Issue Compensation Policy) which will appear on your next bill

## Additional Information:
To avoid similar issues in the future, please ensure you:
1. Have a stable Wi-Fi or cellular connection during eSIM activation
2. Keep your iPhone updated to the latest iOS version
3. Use our mobile app's "eSIM Setup Assistant" feature for guided activation

If you experience any further issues with your eSIM or cellular service, please don't hesitate to contact us. Your satisfaction is our priority.

Thank you for your patience throughout this process and for choosing our service.

Best regards,

Agent TEC-5560
