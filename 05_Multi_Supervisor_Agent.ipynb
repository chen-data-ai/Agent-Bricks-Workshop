    "# Introducing Agent Bricks: Multi-Agent Supervisor\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent Bricks: Multi-Agent Supervisor helps you build a supervisor that routes work across multiple agents and tools—including Genie Spaces, agent endpoints, Unity Catalog functions, and MCP servers—so they can collaborate to solve complex tasks. It handles task delegation and combines results into a single, end-to-end answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-Agent Supervisor builds the system for you and lets you improve it over time with human feedback. It is ideal for supporting the following use cases:\n",
    "- Provide market analysis and insights by searching across research reports and usage data.\n",
    "- Answer questions about internal processes and automate a ticket backlog for it.\n",
    "- Speed up customer service by answering policy, FAQ, account, and other questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Demo Overview\n",
    "In this notebook, we’ll demonstrate a supervisor workflow that combines both **unstructured** and **structured** sources:\n",
    "- **Knowledge Assistant (unstructured):** Answers policy, FAQ, and troubleshooting questions grounded in your documents (from the workshop repo).\n",
    "- **MCP tools (structured):** Handles lookups and tool calls using the tool-calling agent you created (`01_MCP_Tool_Calling_Agent`), including UC functions like `get_order_history(user_name)`."

    "- **Name:** `telecom_support_supervisor`\n",
    "- **Description:** Coordinator for telecom support requests. Routes policy/FAQ questions to a Knowledge Assistant and uses MCP tools for structured lookups (for example, order or customer history). Returns one consolidated response with recommended next steps.\n",

    "- **Use for:** policy, FAQs, troubleshooting, eligibility, and return/exchange questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 MCP lookup tool\n",
    "Add the MCP tool you create in this notebook (for example, `get_order_history(user_name)`).\n",
    "- **Tool name:** `Get_Order_History`\n",
    "- **Use for:** structured lookups (order history, return count, prior issue category)\n",

    "You now have a **Multi-Agent Supervisor** that can handle telecom support requests end-to-end by:\n",

    "- Using the **MCP lookup tool** for structured customer/order history\n",
